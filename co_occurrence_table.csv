pippylepooh,sylvyrfyre,"The precise causes of the Great Dying remain unknown.

Azerajin,sylvyrfyre,"Interesting read from someone else just listing some  similarities, don't need to worry about stitchin but whatever.

It's a stacking of stones that creates our current religions, each the basis for another, and the stories of enki and enlil and adamu are the farthest back we have 



I've always been fascinated by this idea. Not sure how much is true, but I've read that the ancient Sumerians held similar beliefs.

Basically, they had two primary brother ""gods"" known as Enki and Enlil. Enlil is paternal, strict, militant, lawful, impatient, proud. Enki is nurturing, creative, wise, artistic, free, caring, humble.

Enki creates humans (much the same way that Adam and Eve are created, and Adam even shares a similar name ""Adamu""). Enki loves humans, Enlil wants to use humans as labor.

Enlil is the older brother and is given reign of the sky (aka the heavens) while Enki is relegated to the mines that the humans are put to work in (the underworld, aka hell because it's not too fun to be in a mine).

Enlil thinks humans are too independent and can't be trusted (because they revolt), so he imprisons the originals in a garden fortress. Enki disguises himself a serpent and shares knowledge of the world with Adamu and his wife.

Adamu and his wife leave the garden and this pisses off Enlil. There are other humans that exist outside of the garden fortress (as told in the bible, though it makes no sense in the bible but it does make sense in the Sumerian stories because Adamu and his wife aren't presented as the *only* humans that exist in the world).

Enlil then decides to wipe humans off the face of the earth by using floods (yeah, the same floods you read about in the bible). (Edit: there is even a Noah character named Ziusudra who builds an ark). The story is almost identical to the one in the bible. Eventually, Enki makes the rest of the gods (including Enlil) feel kinda bad about it and let the humans live after all.

Humans begin to worship them as gods (since they apparently have the power to end the world, better make sure you're on the their good side from now on). Enlil starts presenting himself a deity. But this ends up creating an even bigger rift between Enki and Enlil.

Enlil starts to get petty and begins trying to amass worshippers. Enki doesn't really need to try that hard, because humans just like him more. This pisses off Enlil who begins to spread the idea of monotheism (as in, you're not allowed to worship anyone but Enlil - he is the one and only God from now on).

This helps explain some of the weird stuff in the old testament. Like, there are times when God is like ""I am love embodied and you are beautiful creatures who I love and adore and I will always be with you!"" and other times when god is like ""Listen up shit heads, here's what the deal is. Accept it or I'll leave you here to die and never come back.""

It makes sense if these are two different ""gods"" talking to the people. But, the Old Testament retcons these multiple gods into a single God.

And so begins a long disinformation campaign to make Enki look like the bad guy, when in fact he is the true friend and creator of humanity. Conspiracy theories say that the war still rages on today between God (aka Enlil) and Enki (Satan/Lucifer). Most ancient religions end up falling to one of two types: militant, strict monotheism, or loose, unorganized poly-theism or even anti-theism. Those religions that are strict militants are factions aligned with Enlil\*, and those that are not are semi-aligned with Enki.

Christianity is therefore revealed as a faction of Enlil, with some nice stuff about love and forgiveness thrown in to tone down the rhetoric, but ultimately, as you can plainly see, the strict militant core of the religion is really the most active ideal. Same with Islam. These religions spend almost all of their energy converting people and preventing any new information from swaying blind faith.

Religions that do not deify any entities and instead focus on growing internally as a human (Gnosticism, Bhuddism) are therefore ""factions"" of Enki - though by nature they are less organized and less dogmatic.

This is a very summarized and bastardized version from my fuzzy memory. There are a lot more details and more characters in the story. Personally, I like to entertain these ideas but do not fully subscribe to any of them.

EDIT: Typo fixes.

Thank you for rewards :)

EDIT 2: There is also a part where two gods are fighting naked and one god bites the other god's dick off. It's a fun read.

EDIT 3: Oh! Another very interesting tidbit. Heard of the old dude Methuselah who lived for centuries? Well, the Sumerian Kings List is a record of how long the kings of Sumer reigned. The kings that ruled after the Deluge have reigns that last for years or decades at most. The kings that ruled before the Deluge? Their reigns lasted for 10's of thousands of years. One might assume that this is just them notating religious beliefs, but the King's List is not at all presented like a religious belief but a historical record and there is no indication anywhere that the super long kingships are based on faith or religious teachings (though modern scholars surely assert that they are).

EDIT 4: The more I think about it, the more details I recall. Another interesting thing is that Enki is represented by a fish symbol because the underworld includes places below water. Recall any other loving creator deities that are represented by a fish symbol?

EDIT 5: OH! One more thing that I found fascinating about Sumer! Have you heard of cuneiform writing? It was the written language of the Sumerians. It consists of little wedge-shaped letters. The prefix ""cun"" is an ancient word for ""wedge-shaped"", and was used to describe female genitalia.  This is where you get words like *cunnilingus* (the ""language"" of vaginas lol) and *cunt*. So Sumerians basically wrote in vagina lettering (according to the ancient romans)!

Weather patterns over time are the definition of climate. Planetary weather patterns over time is the definition of global climate. If you have different definitions I am interested to hear them. 

*Which potential climate drivers do you think are not included*? 
Knowing that we do not know something is not the same as knowing what we do not know. I'm assuming that you agree with this. 
Solar storms, sun spots, global and galactic Birkeland currents, interplanetary plasma, electro magnetic fields, electricity is totally absent from current climate models. I'm sure you agree with that.

Don't forget that in 1912 Alfred Wegener conceptualised and proposed the hypothesis of continental drift; the *scientific community* of the time excoriated and ridiculed him until his death in 1930. They continued after his death until the hypothesis was largely advertised in the 1960s. The supporters of the scientific status quo denied his science for more than fifty years when it was no longer possible to do so.","2 degrees, 40 feet: Scientists who study Earth’s ice say we could be committed to disastrous sea level rise: A new report details that ice sheets are melting quicker than expected, and that the world will need to ramp up its climate efforts to avert disastrous sea level rise.",,2023-11-17 02:34:00

oldwhiteguy35,shallah,">do you agree with every scientist and every published article no matter what it says? 
Neither do I. 

I think you're presuming I think like you do and have a fixed belief before I look at new science, or any idea for that matter. Never disagreeing or ""not believing"" every paper ever is hardly the point. If I don't accept a paper's conclusions, it's not based on what I already think. It's about if the study or data itself ultimately meets the test of peer review. 

The difference between a skeptic and a denier is vast. The denier is one who believes the science is inaccurate because they don't want it to. A skeptic is someone who doesn't accept anything without questioning. However, they do accept results that prove themselves to be valid.

But we'll come back to this.

>Planetary weather patterns over time is the definition of global climate

Yes, but that doesn't make climate projection a weather forecast as in your analogy. It's about the tendencies and likelihoods of the larger patterns. 

>Solar storms, sun spots, global and galactic Birkeland currents, interplanetary plasma, electro magnetic fields, electricity is totally absent from current climate models.

Because studies on solar storms, sun spots, electromagnetic fields demonstrate they aren't a forcing of consequence. As for Birkrland currents (etc) that's an interesting idea. Is there a trend in them anyone has measured that could explain part of the warming? Is there a mechanism by which this could have an effect? How about the others? 

What strikes me about this line of argument is that you seem to be just throwing random ideas about. Almost like you want it to be anything other than carbon dioxide. 

>The last third I disagree with. Neither you nor I are qualified to determine what may or may not be beneficial in the planet's future.

The planet doesn't care. But I think biologists and medical professionals are perfectly capable of figuring out what's good for us and the rest of the ecosystem we depend on. This isn't about my personal opinions. Even if I do think mass extinction isn't a good thing for us... do you disagree?

>Don't forget that in 1912 Alfred Wegener conceptualised and proposed the hypothesis of continental drift; the *scientific community* of the time excoriated and ridiculed him

Like they did with Svante Arrhenius in 1896? Yes, new ideas like AGW or continental drift do often get rebuffed. But the difference between Wegener or Arrhenius and your alternative ideas is the two already had a significant amount of evidence for their theories. You're proposing things that lack supporting evidence. All that's happened in the past 50 years is the case for AGW has become stronger and stronger.

You're also ignoring the fact that climate models are getting the big picture right without other factors. The known physics of the factors in the models explains observations. Introduce a new factor and you'll need to explain why more warming isn't happening. 

They also don't include things that can't be projected into the future. If the models are off we can add that factor in to see if that explains the difference. I've seen that done before.

And that's where the skeptic vs denier comes back. If you show me evidence that these other factors can explain observations, I'm more than willing to accept it. That's skepticism. I remain unchanged for now but I can be convinced. The denier simply isn't interested in the facts and bringing up Wegener or Galileo as if that's something that lends hope to the ABC cause is standard denialism","2 degrees, 40 feet: Scientists who study Earth’s ice say we could be committed to disastrous sea level rise: A new report details that ice sheets are melting quicker than expected, and that the world will need to ramp up its climate efforts to avert disastrous sea level rise.",,2023-11-17 03:32:08

DirewaysParnuStCroix,IAbstainFromSociety,"Well, it really depends on which tipping points are breached first, in what order and how long their effects take to fully play out. I've extensively studied various AMOC theories in relation to the modern climate, so I can give a pretty exhaustive analysis on what I expect to happen with that.

Given what we've already got going for us, my guess would be... ice-free Arctic and permafrost thaw. This would exasperate warming in the northern hemisphere, with the potent heat trapping characteristics of methane and loss of glacial light reflection feeding a runaway warming effect. It'll probably happen before 2050, between then and now we'll see glacial declines and growths but the pattern will ultimately point towards rapid glacial decline. This'll result in what's known as a blue ocean event.


And the AMOC? I expect gradual AMOC slowdown which would hit a minimum flow at the end of the century, but the effects will not be what you think they'll be. Contrary to popular belief, I predict this'll trigger rapid warming across Europe and North America due to the implications of heat not being properly circulated from either the tropics or mid-latitudes. Why? The dynamics for a significant cooldown simply do not exist in the 21st century, actually the complete opposite. We have all the right (or wrong) conditions for runaway warming. 

The cooling hypothesis relies on proxy analyses of what we believe happened in response to AMOC slowdowns in the past. The Younger Dryas is often used as an analog, but it simply isn't comparable to the modern era. The Younger Dryas had significant gargantuan continental glaciers in North America (Laurentide ice shelf) and Europe (Fennoscandinavian). Thus, an AMOC decline under such conditions resulted in these ice shelfs easily expanding southwards and triggering a cooldown in the northern hemisphere. Such extensive ice shelves simply don't exist now, certainly not in the locations they'd need to be to cause significant cooling in response to an AMOC decline. The Greenland ice shelf is the last remnant of this era, and due to its geography is better placed to promote atmospheric blocking patterns across North America and Europe.

The current cocktail of GHGs is already potent enough for us to observe real-time disturbances to atmospheric behaviours, and by the time an AMOC slowdown will be significant enough to have any considerable impacts, its warming effect will already be rapidly outpaced by anthropogenic warming. However, there's a few important details to remember here; the AMOC's warming tendency is mostly confined to the winter period, and during the summer months it actually cools the climate across Europe via precipitation and oceanic weather fronts moving in from a warmer North Atlantic. This is very evident across Western Europe, where rainfall is a big feature of the climate and helps to maintain year round mild temperatures - not too cold in winter, not too hot in summer. When the Atlantic is cooler (due to a weaker AMOC), this creates an atmospheric domino effect that results in notably hotter and drier summer conditions across Europe. This effect is known as the cool-ocean-warm-summer effect and has actually been observed a few times over the past decade, most recently in 2018. Therefore, a weaker or absent AMOC results in a much more pronounced continentality effect and much hotter conditions across Europe due to associated atmospheric blocking patterns in response to the colder ocean surface.

DirewaysParnuStCroix,IAbstainFromSociety,"[cont.]

Basically the AMOC ensures that the climate of the northern hemisphere - especially Europe - is stable and free from extremes of hot and cold. Remove that flow and you'll probably end up with something resembling continental China or Mongolia in terms of extremes of winter and summer climates. And that's what we'd expect to happen under **entirely natural circumstances**... when we consider the implications of anthropogenic warming, the consequences are seemingly much more dire and much more conductive of extremes in heat. Another factor that the regional cooling hypothesis relies on is the response of Hadley cells to an ocean current collapse. Theoretically, the outcome would be that the heat remains confined to the tropics, due to it not being distributed by ocean currents. And again, yes, we might expect this under *natural circumstances*, but our situation is far from natural and is entirely unprecedented. Ocean currents help to distribute heat from the tropics but arguably also prevent it from stalling in the mid latitudes. But GHGs have become so ingrained in our atmosphere and our oceans too that their heat trapping characteristics are outpacing the natural flow of the atmosphere. I thoroughly believe that natural flows such as ocean currents are currently acting to moderate the consequences of the heat imbalance in the atmosphere; remove those currents and all of that anthropogenic-generated heat stagnates and intensifies across the planet, not just the tropics. The earth's energy imbalance is simply far too large for all of that energy to remain confined to the tropics, it's more likely to trigger a massive overflow of stored energy and an expansion in Hadley cell characteristics, ultimately this would push the cells into the mid-latitudes. This is theoretically already happening. And yes, this has all the indicators of a runaway warming event. When the climatic systems begin to break down and can't efficiently regulate the energy present in the system, the excess energy comes to dominate as other systems decline in its wake. 

An AMOC collapse would almost entirely eliminate precipitation patterns, whilst promoting much hotter and drier summer conditions, compounded with an already warming Arctic climate and near total lack of ice sheet coverage, significantly reducing the polar region's ability to cool down and promote colder winter conditions in the lower latitudes. The loss of precipitation also vastly reduces snow potential... this is another fundamental point to consider, the polar regions would continue to warm in response to GHGs. Colder air masses would be almost entirely eliminated, anthropogenic changes to the atmosphere result in a greatly diminished potential for cold in these regions, this would be very amplified by a blue ocean event.

A few final points to consider, though. There's not much in the way of universal agreement when it comes to the AMOC and its climatic role. Many don't consider it to be a major of a feature in relation to Europe's climate, there's no real agreement on how crucial it is to regulating the climates of the North Atlantic. The models used by researchers to estimate the strength and progress of the AMOC have been criticised recently for their accuracy too. 

If we want to really think ahead and look at things on a larger scale, we're actually at the tail end of the current geological Cenozoic ""cold phase"". Proxy data suggests that previous cold phases only lasted about 40-50 million years, the current cold phase is estimated to be at about 45 million years currently. Generally speaking, these cold phases are rare events in earth's history; for most of its existence it has been a substantially warmer planet. However, transitions between warm and cold phases take *millions of years* - we're on track to exit the current period much faster than that. You'd be forgiven for being concerned about this as that's simply unsustainable to life, it's not nearly enough time for nature to respond to an entirely artificially-enduced and rapid change to conditions. Our entire civilization and species have evolved during this current cooler period in earth's history, are we really ready for such an abrupt change that could easily see the tropics forced as far north as the Arctic Circle?

I hope that if there's one take away from this, it's that anthropogenic change is a massive crisis and probably the main driver of how our climate works now.



tl;dr yes I'm sick of people pretending that an AMOC collapse would result in any cooling, it simply isn't a viable outcome under current conditions.

The creation of barrier islands are meant to prevent coastal erosion and reduce the severity of storm surge, particularly during tropical cyclones.

For areas in dry climates, the artificial creation of reservoirs can allow for more water storage that may be tapped into when periods of Drought occur.

Working-Promotion728,Loud_Flatworm_4146,"I moved to San Antonio in 2004, left the state for three years in 2010, and came back to live in Austin in 2013. Summer begins in late April and sticks around until November, full stop. We had some brief brown-outs this summer due to everyone running their AC—myself included—all day and night. You can't open your windows at all during this time of year. The daytime temp is over 100 every day, and at night the humidity shoots up above 90% while the temperature only drops into the low 80s. This is humidity without the mercy of any rain at all. I'm sure the Gulf coast is worse, but perhaps they get a breeze.

During the freeze, I lost power for four days. It was like a boring camping trip for us. We got out our sleeping bags and read books to keep busy. The temps were in the single digits F, so well below freezing. We have good windows, so the house was well insulated. 

When the power came back on, the water went out and stayed that way for another four days. No clean dishes, no showers, no flushing toilets, and we had to ration the store of bottled drinking water we had. The roads were un-driveable and the nearest grocery store is three miles away, and probably also without power. We started dumping snow in the bathtub and melting it on the stovetop because the gas still worked. That melted snow became toilet water.

Texas was once proud of its independent power grid, but we realize now that it's a liability. Many people died in the cold during this one, but imagine how much worse it would be during a Texas summer. Thousands of people would die in the heat with no water and no AC. There's no escaping the heat here. It's relentless and oppressive, day and night, for months on end. I would GTFO.if I could leave this state.",I was in Texas when it froze over.,"I felt like sharing this because it's hard to explain to people if you haven't been through a disaster or potential disaster. And climate change is just not a subject most people want to talk about.

I was living in Austin when Texas froze over in 2021. I didn't lose power in my apt building but we lost water for a few days. Some of my neighbors had to melt snow. Some had filled up their bathtubs with water before the pipes burst.

I had enough water for about a week.  I tried to wash my dishes with melted snow so I could save the fresh water but I just ended up with leaves in my sink. I didn't do the dishes for a few days.

A friend lived 5 minutes from me who lost water and power. She had to stay at a hotel with neighbors and their dogs and her bird.

Another friend on the other side of Austin had no problems. 

One of my neighbors in my building told me that the area of Austin we were in was being prioritized for power from the grid. That was comforting but also terrifying because if we lost power, that meant all of Austin, possibly most of Texas, would.

Later we learned that the Texas grid was just a few minutes from completely shutting down. It would have taken months to get it working again, leaving most of the state in a state of disaster.

I was the only person in my building who had ever dealt with snow or ice while driving. My van was on black ice in the parking lot and I couldn't get it out. If I couldn't, no one there could. So I couldn't leave the property for a week. When I finally could, I went to a few stores and there was no water anywhere. I saw a single bottle on the shelf at the gas station but that was it. 

I was lucky. Others froze. People died. I felt terrible for the people who had no power or water like my friend.

I moved back to my home state in the NE about 2 months later. I didn't want to have to worry about the grid every August with all the ACs blasting and worrying about another freeze that the grid can't handle. I didn't have any faith in the leadership making any changes to fix the situation so it wouldn't happen again. I was very unhappy with the response of the leadership in Texas. Without going into anything political, I'll leave it at that. 

BTW, the reason I moved to Texas to begin with was to get a break from the snow and ice of the Northeast. Oh irony, you got me on that one.

Since then, I've had Texans tell me that central Texas staying hotter longer. When I moved there in 2017, it didn't even start to get cool until late September. Recently, a friend told me it's more like late November now. 

I'm in PA and PA is warmer now than before I left for Texas. We have had very mild winters. I have lived in PA since I was 12. Shoveling snow was a necessity in the winter back then. Not anymore. There was barely any snow in winter 21 or 22. It's chilly now so we might have a colder winter but still no snow in my area. That's not that unusual for mid-November but I wonder how much snow we will get this winter.

That was my first personal experience with climate change and its effects. Unfortunately, not the last since the Canada wildfire smoke covered the area and NYC. For part of that time, the air quality here was worse than NYC. It was a miserable experience. If you were up northeast too, you already know.

We will all have to find ways to adapt. Internal migration will happen first. It's happening in India now. I know there are more Americans like me thinking about or already have moved away from disaster prone areas.

I was living in Austin when Texas froze over in 2021. I didn't lose power in my apt building but we lost water for a few days. Some of my neighbors had to melt snow. Some had filled up their bathtubs with water before the pipes burst.

I had enough water for about a week.  I tried to wash my dishes with melted snow so I could save the fresh water but I just ended up with leaves in my sink. I didn't do the dishes for a few days.

A friend lived 5 minutes from me who lost water and power. She had to stay at a hotel with neighbors and their dogs and her bird.

Another friend on the other side of Austin had no problems. 

One of my neighbors in my building told me that the area of Austin we were in was being prioritized for power from the grid. That was comforting but also terrifying because if we lost power, that meant all of Austin, possibly most of Texas, would.

Later we learned that the Texas grid was just a few minutes from completely shutting down. It would have taken months to get it working again, leaving most of the state in a state of disaster.

I was the only person in my building who had ever dealt with snow or ice while driving. My van was on black ice in the parking lot and I couldn't get it out. If I couldn't, no one there could. So I couldn't leave the property for a week. When I finally could, I went to a few stores and there was no water anywhere. I saw a single bottle on the shelf at the gas station but that was it. 

I was lucky. Others froze. People died. I felt terrible for the people who had no power or water like my friend.

I moved back to my home state in the NE about 2 months later. I didn't want to have to worry about the grid every August with all the ACs blasting and worrying about another freeze that the grid can't handle. I didn't have any faith in the leadership making any changes to fix the situation so it wouldn't happen again. I was very unhappy with the response of the leadership in Texas. Without going into anything political, I'll leave it at that. 

BTW, the reason I moved to Texas to begin with was to get a break from the snow and ice of the Northeast. Oh irony, you got me on that one.

Since then, I've had Texans tell me that central Texas staying hotter longer. When I moved there in 2017, it didn't even start to get cool until late September. Recently, a friend told me it's more like late November now. 

I'm in PA and PA is warmer now than before I left for Texas. We have had very mild winters. I have lived in PA since I was 12. Shoveling snow was a necessity in the winter back then. Not anymore. There was barely any snow in winter 21 or 22. It's chilly now so we might have a colder winter but still no snow in my area. That's not that unusual for mid-November but I wonder how much snow we will get this winter.

That was my first personal experience with climate change and its effects. Unfortunately, not the last since the Canada wildfire smoke covered the area and NYC. For part of that time, the air quality here was worse than NYC. It was a miserable experience. If you were up northeast too, you already know.

We will all have to find ways to adapt. Internal migration will happen first. It's happening in India now. I know there are more Americans like me thinking about or already have moved away from disaster prone areas.

Thanks for reading. I just don't really have anyone in my life to talk to about this topic. It's not an easy topic.

_ZoeyDaveChapelle_,Loud_Flatworm_4146,"Here's my climate change migration story.  I feel like an early adopter of what will be much more common soon.

I lived in Austin for 12 years until a few months ago, and lost power and water for a week then even in a protected grid area, because a tree limb came down on power line and knocked out just our street on one side and crews couldn't get there with no ice trucks.  We couldn't leave or go to the store because roads were iced over, and only survived because I filled tubs beforehand and had a fireplace.. and neighbors who had power donated wood when ours ran out quickly (and hot food).  

Realizing how exposed we actually were to disaster was traumatic enough, and was the first time I started getting serious about moving somewhere with less climate change risk.  Then we watched the power companies and govt. do practically nothing to winterize the grid and just price gouged people off the disaster, and the city added a whopping 2 snowploughs because they couldn't justify expense for more 'rare' winter events.  I started researching and planning where would be a safer place as things inevitably get worse.

Then this last winter had Arborpocalypse (freezing rain weighed down trees) rip apart half the trees all over the city, making it look (and sound) like bombs had dropped and destroying one of our cars.   It took a month or more to clear it. I said fuck this, I've watched '100 year events' start stacking up way too fast to ignore the pattern (house also flooded in 2014, summer heat killed our AC 2 yrs. later and we roasted for over a week trying to get it fixed).

Then I watched a basic right as a woman dissolve, and extremely low voter turnout in response.

After a year of research and planning, I moved to Minnesota in the middle of daily power warnings and water restrictions this summer with almost 3 months of over 100 degree temps and no rain, when everything turned brown and even more established plant life and old trees were lost after the winter stress.  Even native plants were stuggling.  Aquifers were drying up that had never been so low because developers drained more than allowed and just ignored the fines.  It seriously felt like watching the desertification of an area on fast forward, with the influx of people and legalized corruption accelerating it.

The amount of people flabbergasted I could move to some place 'so cold' after living through all this shit themselves was mind-boggling.  Literally acting like I'm a crazy person for trying to put down new roots somewhere that scientists agree will be less affected in the coming decades, has water and the infrastructure to support adverse weather and I'm not treated like breeding livestock.
I had shallow roots there anyway and had the opportunity to move, so I took it.  2 weeks of pleasant weather had people get amnesia about every disaster that's happening multiple times a year now.  Why would you keep investing in a rapidly declining location?  Isn't it 'smart' to recognize this and plan accordingly for 10-20 years in advance, instead of just hoping it's not reality and everything will be fine?

Most people seem incapable of considering their lives will change (even when it undeniably already is) and planning to improve very basic needs for survival, and will be scrambling when it truly falls apart.. when everyone else that ignored reality too long is doing the same.  I get that it's much harder to move for most people than it was for me, but it's going to be even harder if you wait until nature forces you to and no one will buy your home.",I was in Texas when it froze over.,"I felt like sharing this because it's hard to explain to people if you haven't been through a disaster or potential disaster.

Loud_Flatworm_4146,Loud_Flatworm_4146,"When I was still there, I think that ban was still making its way through the Texas court system. But it was just one more reason I was second guessing Texas. I was second guessing Texas before it froze over due to that and other...leadership problems...in the state. 

It honestly was traumatic even though I was fine. I felt incredibly vulnerable. I also have chronic pain, was diagnosed with fibromyalgia just a year and a half before that. My mobility was suffering. I hated being extra vulnerable because of it in that situation.

Then after I left, a friend in Austin had to go to another state for a medical procedure. When she told me, I knew I made the right call to leave.

I moved there before I realized I had fibromyalgia. The symptoms accelerated shortly after the diagnosis so it was the storm, the grid, the leadership, the disability, all of it, that led me to leave. I liked Austin but it just wasn't gonna work out. 

When you get a dose of reality on climate change, it changes your perspective on what you want to do and where you want to go. And I'm soooo tired of people downplaying or outright denying it. I think many deny it because it's just too big to wrap your mind around, too enormous of an issue that can't be easily solved, and fear. Fear that it's true and if it's true, what do you do with that information? Even now, even after all of that, I still have moments where I find myself saying, ""Maybe it won't be that bad. Maybe it won't be as severe as they say it will be."" But I know better.

fxlr_rider,Loud_Flatworm_4146,"Interesting to hear your perspective on the cold snap in 2021 in Texas.  Time will tell if this is an isolated event or a harbinger of worse to come.  No question that there has been significant warming in texas, especially in light of the recent climate report that came out last week.  I think that the wildfire smoke is here to stay.  I live in Canada and the summers have become much hotter with drier spring and fall weather.  From experience, I have seen that the forests in BC and Alberta were tinder dry through most of the spring and summer.  It is having a significant impact on tree growth with many of the cedar trees in the areas I visit dying off from lack of water.  The  higher tree mortality will simply exacerbate the spread of fire next year.  Not sure where is safe to move.  My greatest worry is the loss of glacial fed rivers and streams as the high altitude glaciers continue to disappear.

cclawyer,Loud_Flatworm_4146,"Definitely the changes are happening everywhere. Back in 2016, I tried to move up to a piece of property in Oregon that my wife had owned for many years. First winter there, it was harder than it had been in all our prior experience, and we had to move out. Really deep snow that stayed for a long time.  Too bad, because it seemed like a nice piece of property",I was in Texas when it froze over.,"I felt like sharing this because it's hard to explain to people if you haven't been through a disaster or potential disaster. And climate change is just not a subject most people want to talk about.

I was living in Austin when Texas froze over in 2021. I didn't lose power in my apt building but we lost water for a few days. Some of my neighbors had to melt snow. Some had filled up their bathtubs with water before the pipes burst.

I had enough water for about a week.  I tried to wash my dishes with melted snow so I could save the fresh water but I just ended up with leaves in my sink. I didn't do the dishes for a few days.

A friend lived 5 minutes from me who lost water and power. She had to stay at a hotel with neighbors and their dogs and her bird.

Another friend on the other side of Austin had no problems. 

One of my neighbors in my building told me that the area of Austin we were in was being prioritized for power from the grid. That was comforting but also terrifying because if we lost power, that meant all of Austin, possibly most of Texas, would.

Later we learned that the Texas grid was just a few minutes from completely shutting down. It would have taken months to get it working again, leaving most of the state in a state of disaster.

I was the only person in my building who had ever dealt with snow or ice while driving. My van was on black ice in the parking lot and I couldn't get it out. If I couldn't, no one there could. So I couldn't leave the property for a week. When I finally could, I went to a few stores and there was no water anywhere. I saw a single bottle on the shelf at the gas station but that was it. 

I was lucky. Others froze. People died. I felt terrible for the people who had no power or water like my friend.

I moved back to my home state in the NE about 2 months later. I didn't want to have to worry about the grid every August with all the ACs blasting and worrying about another freeze that the grid can't handle. I didn't have any faith in the leadership making any changes to fix the situation so it wouldn't happen again. I was very unhappy with the response of the leadership in Texas. Without going into anything political, I'll leave it at that. 

BTW, the reason I moved to Texas to begin with was to get a break from the snow and ice of the Northeast. Oh irony, you got me on that one.

Since then, I've had Texans tell me that central Texas staying hotter longer. When I moved there in 2017, it didn't even start to get cool until late September. Recently, a friend told me it's more like late November now. 

I'm in PA and PA is warmer now than before I left for Texas. We have had very mild winters. I have lived in PA since I was 12. Shoveling snow was a necessity in the winter back then. Not anymore. There was barely any snow in winter 21 or 22. It's chilly now so we might have a colder winter but still no snow in my area. That's not that unusual for mid-November but I wonder how much snow we will get this winter.

That was my first personal experience with climate change and its effects. Unfortunately, not the last since the Canada wildfire smoke covered the area and NYC. For part of that time, the air quality here was worse than NYC. It was a miserable experience. If you were up northeast too, you already know.

We will all have to find ways to adapt. Internal migration will happen first. It's happening in India now. I know there are more Americans like me thinking about or already have moved away from disaster prone areas.

I was living in Austin when Texas froze over in 2021. I didn't lose power in my apt building but we lost water for a few days. Some of my neighbors had to melt snow. Some had filled up their bathtubs with water before the pipes burst.

I had enough water for about a week.  I tried to wash my dishes with melted snow so I could save the fresh water but I just ended up with leaves in my sink. I didn't do the dishes for a few days.

A friend lived 5 minutes from me who lost water and power. She had to stay at a hotel with neighbors and their dogs and her bird.

Another friend on the other side of Austin had no problems. 

One of my neighbors in my building told me that the area of Austin we were in was being prioritized for power from the grid. That was comforting but also terrifying because if we lost power, that meant all of Austin, possibly most of Texas, would.

Later we learned that the Texas grid was just a few minutes from completely shutting down. It would have taken months to get it working again, leaving most of the state in a state of disaster.

I was the only person in my building who had ever dealt with snow or ice while driving. My van was on black ice in the parking lot and I couldn't get it out. If I couldn't, no one there could. So I couldn't leave the property for a week. When I finally could, I went to a few stores and there was no water anywhere. I saw a single bottle on the shelf at the gas station but that was it. 

I was lucky. Others froze. People died. I felt terrible for the people who had no power or water like my friend.

I moved back to my home state in the NE about 2 months later. I didn't want to have to worry about the grid every August with all the ACs blasting and worrying about another freeze that the grid can't handle. I didn't have any faith in the leadership making any changes to fix the situation so it wouldn't happen again. I was very unhappy with the response of the leadership in Texas. Without going into anything political, I'll leave it at that. 

BTW, the reason I moved to Texas to begin with was to get a break from the snow and ice of the Northeast. Oh irony, you got me on that one.

Since then, I've had Texans tell me that central Texas staying hotter longer. When I moved there in 2017, it didn't even start to get cool until late September. Recently, a friend told me it's more like late November now. 

I'm in PA and PA is warmer now than before I left for Texas. We have had very mild winters. I have lived in PA since I was 12. Shoveling snow was a necessity in the winter back then. Not anymore. There was barely any snow in winter 21 or 22. It's chilly now so we might have a colder winter but still no snow in my area. That's not that unusual for mid-November but I wonder how much snow we will get this winter.

That was my first personal experience with climate change and its effects. Unfortunately, not the last since the Canada wildfire smoke covered the area and NYC. For part of that time, the air quality here was worse than NYC. It was a miserable experience. If you were up northeast too, you already know.

We will all have to find ways to adapt. Internal migration will happen first. It's happening in India now. I know there are more Americans like me thinking about or already have moved away from disaster prone areas.

Thanks for reading. I just don't really have anyone in my life to talk to about this topic. It's not an easy topic.

s0cks_nz,Loud_Flatworm_4146,Oh it definitely is. The poles are warming faster which is reducing the temperature difference between the poles and the equator. This means the polar vortex (jet streams) that normally keep the super cold air from the poles from dropping down too low have become weakened allowing cold arctic air to come down further south (and warmer air to move into the poles).

I'm in PA and PA is warmer now than before I left for Texas. We have had very mild winters. I have lived in PA since I was 12. Shoveling snow was a necessity in the winter back then. Not anymore. There was barely any snow in winter 21 or 22. It's chilly now so we might have a colder winter but still no snow in my area. That's not that unusual for mid-November but I wonder how much snow we will get this winter.

That was my first personal experience with climate change and its effects. Unfortunately, not the last since the Canada wildfire smoke covered the area and NYC. For part of that time, the air quality here was worse than NYC. It was a miserable experience. If you were up northeast too, you already know.

We will all have to find ways to adapt. Internal migration will happen first. It's happening in India now. I know there are more Americans like me thinking about or already have moved away from disaster prone areas.

No_Difference8518,Loud_Flatworm_4146,"Yikes. The worst we have here in Ottawa is about -30C (-22F). Never cold enough to lose water. We do lose power on occasion though, but not often in the winter.",I was in Texas when it froze over.,"I felt like sharing this because it's hard to explain to people if you haven't been through a disaster or potential disaster. And climate change is just not a subject most people want to talk about.

I was living in Austin when Texas froze over in 2021. I didn't lose power in my apt building but we lost water for a few days. Some of my neighbors had to melt snow. Some had filled up their bathtubs with water before the pipes burst.

I had enough water for about a week.  I tried to wash my dishes with melted snow so I could save the fresh water but I just ended up with leaves in my sink. I didn't do the dishes for a few days.

A friend lived 5 minutes from me who lost water and power. She had to stay at a hotel with neighbors and their dogs and her bird.

Another friend on the other side of Austin had no problems. 

One of my neighbors in my building told me that the area of Austin we were in was being prioritized for power from the grid. That was comforting but also terrifying because if we lost power, that meant all of Austin, possibly most of Texas, would.

Later we learned that the Texas grid was just a few minutes from completely shutting down. It would have taken months to get it working again, leaving most of the state in a state of disaster.

I was the only person in my building who had ever dealt with snow or ice while driving. My van was on black ice in the parking lot and I couldn't get it out. If I couldn't, no one there could. So I couldn't leave the property for a week. When I finally could, I went to a few stores and there was no water anywhere. I saw a single bottle on the shelf at the gas station but that was it. 

I was lucky. Others froze. People died. I felt terrible for the people who had no power or water like my friend.

I moved back to my home state in the NE about 2 months later. I didn't want to have to worry about the grid every August with all the ACs blasting and worrying about another freeze that the grid can't handle. I didn't have any faith in the leadership making any changes to fix the situation so it wouldn't happen again. I was very unhappy with the response of the leadership in Texas. Without going into anything political, I'll leave it at that.

That's not a non-action. Making a bet that for 5 years you won't add coal is very significant. Even if existing permitted plants are built over that time, in 5 years you will have nothing on the pipeline, while solar capacity is expected to explode, not just based on some plan but because manufacturing is exploding.

>New coal power projects are unnecessary to meet demand

So that ultimately means they will operate at a reduced capacity factor, [which fits the existing trend of decreasing capacity factors](https://powermin.gov.in/en/content/power-sector-glance-all-india)

>India has an estimated 65.3 GW of proposed, on-grid coal capacity under active development:
30.4 GW under construction and 34.9 GW in pre-construction (14.4 GW permitted, 11.8 GW pre-permit, and 8.8 GW announced)

This is assuming that not only all permitted projects move forward, but that anything annonced is built. Also, I can't find a source confirmation on what projects are moving forward with the ban, I can't tell if the pre-permits are allowed, but they may well be. 

[Overall coal capacity additions are down 85% since 2014](https://globalenergymonitor.org/press-release/india-enters-an-unnecessary-coal-plant-permitting-spree-in-2023/), an enormous drop. And in 2022 no new plants were permitted. 

>Sunil Dahiya from Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said, “Electricity demand estimated in India’s National Electricity Plan has always been over-projected compared to real demand. In the past, this has led to billions of dollars worth of coal power plants turning into non-performing assets (NPA). The ongoing push for more coal power proposals already exceeds requirements and therefore could again lead to more stranded assets.”

[coal is also being pushed out of industrial heating](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indian-industry-turns-biomass-capital-bans-coal-pollution-fight-2023-01-24/)

I'm not trying to argue that India isn't building new plants at all obviously, but of every country in earth India is likely the one I have the most confidence in actually building out Solar as the main energy source. I would argue the current focus on coal is in part due to restrictions on the amount of solar manufacturing capacity which is growing rapidly in China and India.

Causes:

Coal prices bounced around between $50 and $120 a ton in the years leading up to covid.  Then Xi got upset with Australia for bashing China's lack of transparency on whatever it was that came ""straight outta Wuhan"".  

Xi did one of those DICtator moves and banned Aussie coal.  He cranked up domestic production and imports from Indonesia to comp for the shortfall.  But his local workers went on strike after some bad accidents - likely caused by the mad dash to crank up production.

TheRealBobbyJones,FWGuy2,It isn't set in stone. As long as investment in solar continues to increase its entirely possible that India wouldn't be able to increase their coal power plants as much as they would want to anyways. This is a semi-free market. It's similar to China approving a ton of coal power plants. Statistically it looks bad on its face until you realize that a lot of permits aren't acted on or that some existing plants are already operating at reduced capacity. That is because of renewables. If Chinese solar panels are cheap abroad imagine how cheap they are domestically. Even if China continues to approve coal their free market will limit its usage. The same should apply to India.

Planetologist1215,Impressive_Coffee244,"Questions like these are always way too complex to give simple yes or no answers, yet they still pop up all the time on here. Forest carbon modeling is *extremely* complicated, as is all environmental modeling, and there are so many factors to consider that the answer is most likely ""*it depends*"".

As someone who does forest carbon modeling research, some of these factors might be:

\- what is the pyrolysis feedstock, whole logs, pulpwood logs only, logging residues, sawmill residues, or combinations of all/some of them?

\- what types of forest management are being used, what types of trees, and where? intensive plantations or more semi-natural managed forests? what are the rotation ages?

\- what types of harvests are used to obtain those feedstocks, clear cuts, selective logging, something else, etc?

\- what type of pyrolysis is being used? different types can produce different proportions of pyrolysis products. Is the focus purely to maximize biochar or to maximize biooil and syngas with biochar as a useful byproduct?

\- how are those pyrolysis products used? are they used to substitute for existing fossil uses? what methods will we use to account for these coproducts?

\- if these are from intensively managed plantation forests, do we consider foregone carbon sequestration and foregone storage from intensive land use/management? this is HUGELY important for carbon modeling and results in a carbon debt that takes time to pay off

\- how do we handle the issue of biogenic carbon stored in the biomass itself? 

All of these factors will have huge impacts on the carbon modeling so a simple one size fits all answer isn't really possible.",Could we store CO2 through pyrolysis?,"The problem with planting trees to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is that trees will decompose and release the CO2 back into the atmosphere.

A steady and gradual decrease in world population predictably would reduce the hourly and daily amounts of new man-made CO2 emissions and other new greenhouse gas emissions that will be released into the global atmosphere by human activities over the coming minutes, hours, days, years and decades.       
          
***   
                   
Unfortunately, global warming will continue to increase because man-made CO2 emissions released since the onset of the Industrial Revolution (circa 1750) still will remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years.  
           
***   
                
If the global amount of CO2 and other greenhouse emissions released by human activities slowly decreases over the coming hours, days, years, and decades, global warming in the coming months, years, and decades predictably will not be as extreme as if GHG emissions continue at the current increasing global rate.     
             
***        
         
If the world population halved their emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHG)   today and continued reducing GHG emissions to 2030 and for the rest of their lives, global warming, global heat waves, global extreme temperatures, global extreme storms, global extreme rainfall and flooding, global extreme drought, extreme global wildfires, global sea level rise, and other extreme climate change consequences predictably would not be as severe in 2030 and beyond as they otherwise would be.

On November 16, 2023, someone will drive a fossil-fuel powered car. The CO2 emissions in the exhaust will remain in the global atmosphere to 4023 and beyond.

>This is one of the great feedback loops we are facing. Any one of them is bad, but multiple happening at the same time is catastrophic. 

I agree, which is why I am particularly concerned with the regional effect NG extraction is having as it could theoretically be dealt with much fast than global trends. 

>When the Arctic ocean has zero sea ice during the summer the albedo change from reflective white to absorbent blue will trigger a massive continuous warming event that will change ocean currents around the globe.

This concerns me as well, as with a shut down of the Atlantic current due to fresh water inflow. I wonder if the result of this will be much higher snow levels, due to evaporation in the arctic ocean, which may kick off the reverse loop of glacial formation.",Faster Arctic warming hastens 2C rise by eight years,,2023-11-16 05:29:34
MaxRockatanskisGhost,lollosers990,"First point I have no source. Sorry. 

Second, not sure about NG extraction. I don't know enough about it to have an option. 

Third. The thing about the BOE is that all these global oceanic currents rely on a system of warm water traveling north while the cold water from the north travels south *under* the warm water. Once we see a BOE a few years later there will be no cold water to subduct under! He warm water and the entire current will stop or change dramatically. This current is why we have the weather we have on the eastern seaboard of the  US and the warm summer weather that Europe enjoys. I know much less about the Pacific currents but I believe they operate from the same principle in the Bering Sea. 

These currents have operated for thousands of years based on this transfer of cold water south and warm water north. Once there isn't sufficient cold water to head south then there is no reason for the warm water to head north. We could be looking at year round hurricane season as the oceans stagnant.

There are two main sources of deep ocean water - Arctic and Antarctic.  Both are formed when the sea freezes, creating a cold, high-salt water that goes to the bottom and heads south /north respectively.

The point is that this water is formed when sea ice forms, and that will continue happening even if the Arctic is ice-free in summer.  It's not going to stay ice free through the winter.

Perhaps the 2013 ice extent scared the Canadian government enough to outlaw the practice since rescue would be difficult, but now money-talks so changed that.

Musikaravaa,RyanWhite27,"That's the tip of the iceberg and one facet of the problem. When you add the carbon emissions from our ways of living (transportation, heating technology development) then it starts to make a blanket around the planet which traps more energy from the sun and warms the earth further. As the earth warms it changes the temperature of the water as well which disrupts typical weather patterns over time and kills ocean life reducing our food supplies and releases more methane which makes the planet even hotter and the cycle continues. More trees and plants and animals struggle to live above the temperatures they developed in and die and it's a feedback loop of disasters and hot planet.",Out Forrest,"

CalLaw2023,alamohero,">Who says there is no evidence?

Nobody.  Whether evidence exists or not is irrelevant to my point.  What is relevant is the evidence that any particular climate scientist has when publishing a paper.  I am sure you want to pretend that every scientist out there researching anything about the climate has a singular goal of proving or disproving the AGW hypothesis.  That is not reality.  Most climate research focuses on a particular thing that does not always relate to the AGW hypothesis.  And even if it does, that does not mean that scientist has sufficient evidence to make a conclusion about the AGW hypothesis.       

​

>Because I am an astrophysicist, not a climate scientist. I understand how science works and how much it takes to achieve a consensus. I don't understand enough about this super complicated field to debate the validity of evidence, and I doubt you do either.

And that is the typical deflection. Nobody is willing to discuss evidence.  Anytime anybody challenges the hypothesis, the response is it must be true because there is a consensus, even though there is no actual consensus.   

Patrick Brown recently acknowledged in an interview that climate scientists need to tailor their papers to highlight the narrative that man is causing global warming to get published.      

The point is this is propaganda.  When you manipulate data by ignoring 70% of papers to claim a 99.9% consensus, you are creating propaganda.  When publishers of scientific journals choose what to publish based on the paper taking a desired position, you are creating propaganda.  When everyone pushing that narrative refuses to discuss the topic on the merits, you are peddling propaganda.  

Even if we pretend that 99.9% of climate scientists agree, that still leaves 0.1% who disagree.  That 0.1% could be correct.  But nobody wants to discuss the merits because it destroys the propaganda.  The data does not exist to confirm or refute the AGW hypothesis.  Is the warming over the last 120 years unprecedented when compared to the last 800,000 years?  That is the claim, but how do we know that?  We have pretty graphs showing us the average temperature over the last 800,000 years with a very clear spike over the last 100 or so years.  But where did that data come from?  Well, we can't talk about that because it destroys the narrative.  

People's trust in scientific research is at an all time low because of the propaganda.  Science is about the merits.  The AGW debate is political.  We are told we don't need to know the merits because the science is settled, when it is far from it.  We are told we need to accept the AGW hypothesis is true until it is definitely proven false, which is propaganda; not science.",How do I respond to this take on climate change?,"“Yes the climate is changing but it is a natural cycle.

But if most postal workers refused to deliver survey results if they did not support the President, and 50 responses were sent in that did not say yes or no, you claiming 96% support would be propaganda.

No, I don't. Climate scientists are well beyond that, much like astrophysicists don't usually try to prove that dark matter exist and are more curious about its properties (you know, because there is already a consensus on the former). That is literally what I was talking about in the first half of our argument, where 2000 out of 3000 papers did not talk about AGW because they were researching more specific things.

For someone claiming to want to debate evidence you show absolutely zero evidence. You just deflect and muddy the waters. There is a consensus both in published papers (>90% of published papers don't talk about AGW because they are not climate science related) and in personal conviction in climate scientists.

About 20% of americans believe in creationism, there are always stupid people and outliers, if there is a 99% consensus in a field of scientists (who are notoriously sceptical in both their and other people's research), I'll take it.

This is exactly the point.

These were your words, right?

>In reality, 892 / 88,125 = 0.01. But I get it. That is not fair because they really only looked at 3,000 abstracts. So if we assume those 3,000 are a representative sample, we are left with 892 out of 3,000 endorsing the AGW hypothesis, and 2,104 / 3,000 taking no position on it.

Does the fact that there were 31 papers published rejecting  or skeptical of ACC not mean anything to you? Out of curiosity, do you have any peer reviewed publications? Are you familiar with how the process actually works?

If you think the authors methodology is flawed and they didn't properly capture skeptical papers, you're more than welcome to publish your own updated analysis.

There are still dozens of options of journals that would accept publications that rejected or were skeptical of ACC if they didn't have glaring issues that couldn't pass basic peer review. In fact, I'd be willing to wager that there are many more low-tier or open access journals that would be open to those papers than the larger journals that would immediately be skeptical of them like Nature, etc.

CalLaw2023,alamohero,">Publication does not hinge upon supporting ACC. You’re simply making that up.

Nope.  But it is telling that you are ignoring the facts that support that claim.  In September of this year, researcher, Patrick Brown indicated in an interview that he omitted data about nonclimate causes of wildfire in a paper he published because he suspected editors of the journal Nature would have rejected his research if it failed to exclusively blame human-caused greenhouse gases for intensifying blazes.  That interview got major headlines and the press investigated.  The journal Nature denied that they would have rejected it, but many other researchers acknowledged that it is a widespread belief among climate researchers that your chance of publication is significantly lower if you take a position adverse to man is the problem.

In light of that, look at the data.  Out of 3,000 papers that used keywords about climate change or global warming, 70% of them did not take a position regarding human being the cause.

Here is Patrick Brown explaining it:

>The paper I just published—“Climate warming increases extreme daily wildfire growth risk in California”—focuses exclusively on how climate change has affected extreme wildfire behavior. I knew not to try to quantify key aspects other than climate change in my research because it would dilute the story that prestigious journals like Nature and its rival, Science, want to tell.

This matters because it is critically important for scientists to be published in high-profile journals; in many ways, they are the gatekeepers for career success in academia. And the editors of these journals have made it abundantly clear, both by what they publish and what they reject, that they want climate papers that support certain preapproved narratives—even when those narratives come at the expense of broader knowledge for society.

To put it bluntly, climate science has become less about understanding the complexities of the world and more about serving as a kind of Cassandra, urgently warning the public about the dangers of climate change. However understandable this instinct may be, it distorts a great deal of climate science research, misinforms the public, and most importantly, makes practical solutions more difficult to achieve.

There definitely is a push in academia for publications in high end journals. This is largely due to the competitive nature of academia.

>Authority in the scientific literature

We begin our comparative analysis by measuring group-level contributions to the CC literature in peer-reviewed scientific journals, namely, those that meet WOS rigorous indexing standards. In order to associate individual CCC and CCS with research articles, we match individuals’ names to the list of coauthors associated with each WOS publication, using a tested method to address the author name disambiguation problem45. Accordingly, we find that only 224 of the 386 CCC have a single publication in our WOS dataset. Thus, in our analysis drawing on scientific publication data, we proceed by comparing just the 224 published CCC with a size-balanced subset comprised of the 224 most-cited CCS. We denote these two subsets by 224CCC and 224CCS, respectively.
  

  
Proceeding at the group level, we tallied the total number of unique publications (i.e., counting a publication coauthored by two or more members of a given group only once). Figure 3a shows the disparity in scientific productivity, with the 224CCC subset publishing 3367 scientific articles (on average 15 articles per individual). Conversely, the 224CCS subset published 12,665 scientific articles, roughly 3.8 times more than the 224CCC.

Why is it that opponents of the AGW hypothesis are published 3.8 times less often than advocates?  Oh wait, here is somebody with an answer:

CalLaw2023,alamohero,"No, that would be the author of the study and you.  Lets recap, shall we:

You claimed a ""very high confidence, to where 99.9% of scientific publications citing human activity for driving the climate crisis.""  And yet your source identified 88,125 papers that mentioned 'climate change', 'global climate change' and 'global warming', of which only 892 were identified that had any sort of endorsement of the AGW hypothesis. So according to you 892 / 88,125 = 0.999.  In reality, 892 / 88,125 = 0.01.  

But I get it.  That is not fair because they really only looked at 3,000 abstracts. So if we assume those 3,000 are a representative sample, we are left with 892 out of 3,000 endorsing the AGW hypothesis, and 2,104 / 3,000 taking no position on it.  

So why are you pretending 99.9% of papers agree, when your actual source says they only looked at 3.4% of papers, and of the ones they looked at, 70% don't take a position?  The answer is because you are peddling an agenda.  

The actual concensus is we don't know.  There is sparse evidence to support the AGW hypothesis and a lot of evidence to question it.  The biggest problem is the lack of data.  You claim that ""the rate of change has not occured in 800,000 years.""  But we don't have 800,000 years of data.

How do we know what the temperature has been over the last 800,000 years?   And be specific.

That was recently highlighted by researcher, Patrick Brown, who admitted that he omitted data from a paper because he suspected editors of the journal would have rejected his research if it failed to exclusively blame human-caused greenhouse gases.

This is true, the issue is that you are misunderstanding what consensus means. You don't calculate the consensus of a given position by comparing the papers which supported that position against the entire sample of papers on the general topic. That tells you no information about the consensus of papers which supported the position. 

If I sent out a survey to 100 people asking if they support the President and I get 48 responses back who answered yes and 2 answered no, the conclusion here is not 48% of people support the President...this is exactly what you are doing.",How do I respond to this take on climate change?,"“Yes the climate is changing but it is a natural cycle.

Thats not right at all. The consensus is not 892 papers out of 88,125...

They randomly sub-sampled 3,000 papers of the total 88,125 papers. Of their sample, 2,718 were climate-related and only 4 rejected ACC, as they state here:

>*""Our estimate of the proportion of consensus papers was 1 − (4/2718) = 99.85%. The 95% confidence limits for this proportion are 99.62%–99.96% (see R code in supplementary info), therefore it is likely that the proportion of climate papers that favour the consensus is at least 99.62%.""*

Now, not all of the papers in their samples *explicitly* endorsed ACC. Of the random sample, 2,104 papers took no position (as in they didn't address or mention the cause of global warming) while 892 explicitly or implicitly supported anthropogenic climate change (ACC). So recalculating the consensus removing those that took no position, would still give \~ 99.5% consensus as the authors state here,

>. So recalculating the consensus removing those that took no position, would still give \~ 99.5% consensus as the authors state here,

Yep. That is the propaganda.  The actual consensus is that most climate scientists don't take a position on the AGW hypothesis because there is not enough evidence to support or deny it.  It is a valid hypothesis, but it is not yet proven or disproven.  But saying that the vast majority of published papers don't take a position on the AGW hypothesis goes against the desired narrative.",How do I respond to this take on climate change?,"“Yes the climate is changing but it is a natural cycle.

I'm not sure if you are just trolling now or what. 

You don't calculate the consensus as 892/2,718 papers. All that tells you is that, of a sample of 2,718 papers on climate change, 892 supported ACC. That is not the consensus of papers supporting ACC. Do you not see that?

Of that sample, 4 papers explicitly rejected or were skeptical of ACC. So, the proportion of papers that favored the consensus, i.e. **did not reject ACC, out of a sample of papers on climate change was...**

>""**1 − (4/2718) = 99.85%**. The 95% confidence limits for this proportion are 99.62%–99.96% (see R code in supplementary info), **therefore it is likely that the proportion of climate papers that favour the consensus is at least 99.62%.""**
  


Of those 2,718 papers, a total of 896 were about the causes of climate change.

4 papers rejected, 892 papers were in favor. So, the consensus of papers which supported ACC, **of the sample of papers which were about the causes of climate change**, is **1-(4/896) = 99.5%**.

Still, this hides a lot of information because they used a random sample. So the authors went a step further and attempted to quantify how many papers of the total population of papers (88,125) were skeptical. And **they found that only 31 were skeptical of ACC**.

CalLaw2023,alamohero,"Are you trolling?  I understand how they reached their results.  I am challenging their methodology.  You seem to just want to ignore what I am actually arguing.

A few months ago, researcher Patrick Brown highlighted how he omitted data about non-human causes of climate change because he suspected editors would have rejected his research if it failed to exclusively blame human-caused greenhouse gases.  The argument here is 99.9% of published papers agree that the AGW hypothesis is true.  But to get to that conclusion, you are excluding the vast majority of papers.  

​

>Of those 2,718 papers, a total of 896 were about the causes of climate change.

No.  The categories were impacts, methods, mitigation, not climate related,  opinion, and Paleoclimate.  So for example, there were 1,221 papers about the impacts of climate change.  Of those, only 306 implicitly or explicitly endorsed the AGW hypothesis and 915 did not provide and endorsement or a rejection. 

The propaganda conclusion here would be that 100% of papers on the impacts of climate change agree that man is causing it.  In reality, 75% of the papers on the impact took no position on the causes.

Can facts be spun? Of course. Have climate scientists ever made mistakes or had differences of opinion? Of course.  But the fossil fuel industry, and others who don't want to admit climate change is happening are much more talented and frequent to cherry pick misleading statistics.

Whenever I look something up for ""no climate change"" argument, I almost always find its spin, or irrelevant in the larger context.   l have to go with the majority opinion, the 97% of climate scientists who are sounding the alarm, and the the *billion-dollar-every-three-weeks climate events* that have been happening that I see regularly on the news.

And here's a few fossil fuel disinformation and other studies and references just for fun; there are thousands of them.

AstronutApe,alamohero,"You really believe oil is the driver of climate change? You know entire civilizations were wiped out by climate changes, many thousands of years ago, and it would not be unusual for climate to be a threat to our current civilization even without any oil usage. So yes climate change is a problem regardless of the driving factors, but you only ever seem concerned about oil and gas? And you are certain those are the driving factors, and that doing anything about them in the United State would have any meaningful impact on the climate at this point? And you are certain that impact would be purely positive and not have any negative ramifications?

If you could convince me of your position and plan to resolve climate change (whatever you think that means), I would be impressed. I have degrees in space science and engineering so I understand the chemical and thermal issues, so feel free to be specific. 

Just so you know, humans can only tolerate < 0.29 psi partial pressure of CO2 without any danger. The current partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere is 0.00617 psi, way way less. I would think that humans are at least on par with CO2 sensitivity as the Earth’s natural thermal balancing, but that is not even close to what you are proposing. 

A simplified low-ball calculation shows that according to the current process (the “science”) of determining global temperature change based on doubling of CO2 concentration, and extrapolating a relationship purely between CO2 and temperature change… the Earth would change by almost 250 deg F before humans start to experience hypercapnia.

A) CO2 and CH4  both absorb IR radiation ... there is no doubt about this and can be shown in a basic lab ... energy balance is between incoming solar and outgoing terrestrial IR

B) CO2, CH4, H2O and other trace gases are the primary greenhouse gases in the troposphere that keep earth from being an iceball.  H20 is the primary,  so even doubling CO2 only adds a few degrees (though, those few can be significant to us!)

C) human emissions have added a significant amount of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere .. there is no doubt, it's silly to argue this even

D) therefore, without any feedback mechanisms (such as changes in moisture and clouds),  we would expect the temperature of the atmosphere to increase.... the wild card has been determining the complex system of feedbacks

I use HC refrigerant, which works better than R-12 and no threat to the planet, but the U.S. EPA opposes it for no valid reason.

Unlike what most people image, I had no classes about automobiles in college.  Everything I learned was from fixing my own vehicles, and info wasn't as easy to find before the internet.  I've rebuilt engines and transmissions, repaired crash damage, pretty much everything, and don't have the sometimes strange ideas that hobbyists and mechanics do, especially concerning cooling systems and fluid flow.  Did you know that many claim that adding a flow restrictor in the coolant flow will improve the cooling since otherwise, ""coolant passes too fast thru the radiator to cool off"".  Strangely, a thermostat works the opposite way.  They will argue with an engineer until blue in the face about it.  Similarly, homeowners will argue not to turn down the heat when away since ""it takes more energy to heat the house up again"".  Plus, the weird ideas that turning on a light costs 25c, and a sonic boom occurs ""when an object first passes thru the speed of sound"".  What crazy uncle filled their minds with such nonsense?",How do I respond to this take on climate change?,"“Yes the climate is changing but it is a natural cycle.

engineheader,alamohero,"Well you must be one of the rare engineers out there.  Most I deal with have no idea what it takes to fix a car and thing it is much more complicated than it is.

A lot of the reason people have certain points of views with cars is due to their experiences.  I know a guy that had a car he drove from Chicago to Florida in a snow storm and had to block off his radiator to build heat in the engine so it would run correctly.  You can have an engine cooled too much and not enough, fine line.  I know a restriction in a power steering system helps build pressure. I can show you a power steering line with a restrictor in it.  Most people don’t get that pump create flow not pressure.  Restrictions create pressure.

It is then a cat and mouse game of fallacy and rebuttal. If the contrarian is hardened enough they will eventually dig in their heels and invoke fraud and conspiracy.

In fact, most people enjoy the benefits of HVAC in commercial structures because they use CO2 NDIRs to control the system. That's right. The mechanism responsible for greenhouse effect is used in almost every commercial HVAC installation. The only caveat here is that NDIRs typically exploit the minor active band at 4.3 um instead of the terrestrial band at 15 um. But I think if you can convince someone that CO2 traps 4.3 um radiation then it isn't a huge leap to convince them that it works at 15 um as well.

The experiment is also performed by the many space based radiometers. For example, if you look at channel 16 on the GOES-R satellites you'll see attenuation on the limbs as the terrestrial radiation must through more CO2 than it does at the nadir. Channel 16 is the ""CO2"" channel.

ljlee256,alamohero,"We aren't talking about a normal rate of change though, yes the Earths temp rises and falls, but it takes a long time to do that.

To give some perspective the single greatest loss of life on Earth was the permian extinction event, which happened about 252 million years ago and 57% of **biological families** (groups containing multiple species, like canidae which contains foxes and coyotes), 83% of genera (which is more specific like ""dog"" but not so specific as to say ""labrador""), and 81% of marine species were wipied out, like this was a **bad scene**.

That was caused by global warming, 10ish degrees c, which took 15 **million** years to carry out, we've increased the temperature of Earth by 1 degree c in 100 years.

The reason we aren't screwed yet is because we haven't the point of no return, but the track we're on means we will cause the single greatest loss of life the planet has EVER seen and do it about 15,000 times faster than the runner up worst extinction event.

Earth is very resilient, the organic life on also resilient, but species take millions of years to evolve tolerances to new temperatures, we may very well exterminate everything short of extremophiles (micro organic life that lives in very extreme environments), we're possibly going to destroy all macrocellular life entirely, and quite likely to exterminate all macrocellular animal life, and almost certainly going to end mammal life in the process of this.",How do I respond to this take on climate change?,"“Yes the climate is changing but it is a natural cycle.

mulletator,alamohero,"As a geophysicist who has delved deeply into the complexities of Earth's natural cycles, I find the current state of climate change discourse concerning, particularly the trend towards alarmism and what can almost be described as a cult-like following of certain climate narratives.
  



  
Alarmism in climate discussions often overshadows the nuanced understanding of climate dynamics. The portrayal of an imminent, catastrophic climate crisis not only oversimplifies the issue but also overlooks the intricate interplay between natural cycles and human activities. Earth's climate history is marked by long-term cycles such as Milankovitch cycles, solar radiation variations, and volcanic activities, which have significantly influenced climate patterns throughout geological time. These natural processes are complex and not fully understood yet, but they are crucial components of the Earth's climate system.


  

  
The problem with alarmist rhetoric is that it can lead to reactionary policies and measures that may not be grounded in scientific reality or practicality. It fosters a sense of panic and urgency that can overshadow reasoned debate and the careful consideration of evidence. This, in turn, can lead to inefficient allocation of resources, misplaced priorities, and policies that might not effectively address the real challenges of climate change.


  

  
Moreover, the cult-like adherence to certain viewpoints in the climate debate stifles open scientific inquiry and discussion. Science thrives on skepticism and the rigorous testing of hypotheses. When certain theories or models become dogma, it impedes progress and understanding. This is particularly true in a field as complex and multifaceted as climate science, where our understanding is continually evolving.


  

  
It's crucial to approach climate change with a balanced perspective, one that recognizes the significance of human-induced changes while also acknowledging the role of natural climatic cycles. Policies should be based on a comprehensive understanding of the climate system, realistic assessments of technological capabilities, and socio-economic considerations. It's not just about reducing carbon emissions; it's about doing so in a way that is sustainable, economically viable, and adaptable to our evolving understanding of climate dynamics.",How do I respond to this take on climate change?,"“Yes the climate is changing but it is a natural cycle.

mulletator,alamohero,"The significant increase in atmospheric CO2 levels from about 285 ppm to 422 ppm is a pivotal aspect of modern climate science. The well-established understanding that CO2 absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the Earth, thus contributing to the greenhouse effect, is fundamental and not a point of contention.
  

  
Early climate models, developed decades ago, have demonstrated a certain level of accuracy in predicting temperature increases correlated with rising CO2 levels. These predictions, which have been largely validated by subsequent observations, highlight the potential of climate models as tools for understanding future climate scenarios.
  

  
However, as a geophysicist with a critical perspective on some mainstream climate change theories, I focus on the intricacies and complexities of Earth's climate system. It's important to recognize that, despite the significant role of CO2 as a greenhouse gas, the climate system is influenced by a myriad of variables and feedback mechanisms, such as cloud dynamics, oceanic circulation, and natural factors like solar radiation and volcanic activity, which are not yet fully understood.
  

  
The challenges faced by climate models, particularly in backcasting past climate conditions accurately, are significant. Not a single climate model can backcast with complete certainty, a fact that underscores the complexity of the climate system and the limitations of our current modeling techniques. This challenge has led the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to utilize an ensemble of models, allowing for a broader range of scenarios and offsetting the limitations of individual models. This ensemble approach underscores the inherent uncertainties and complexities in climate modeling and reflects the ongoing evolution of our understanding of climate dynamics.
  

  
This perspective does not negate the impact of CO2 or the utility of climate models. Rather, it advocates for a comprehensive and balanced approach to climate change, one that recognizes the interplay between human-induced changes and natural climate dynamics. This approach calls for careful evaluation of data and models, continual refinement of our understanding, and the development of realistic and effective climate strategies. It's about finding a sustainable path forward that integrates scientific insights with pragmatic and adaptable environmental policies.",How do I respond to this take on climate change?,"“Yes the climate is changing but it is a natural cycle.

That is minimal concern since might take >100 years at today's rate to realize that much CO2.  The concern is what changes that could trigger, particularly in the increase in water vapor, which is a much stronger greenhouse gas.  Predictions per climate models vary from no change to +5 C.

Hotter, climate change, colder, climate change always with the human fault story. It would be much more impactful to acknowledge there are at least two distinct things going on. 1. Natural climate change.  The earth, it's irrefutable,  has gone through many climate cycles naturally, there have been hotter periods, colder periods all without an industrial age. Think Athabasca Glacier in Alberta, today a vast area is covered in a glacier but they know underneath are forests as many tree have been pushed up from receding and growing ice cycles. Clearly where that glacier is today that area was much warmer in the past. 2. Human influence on climate. It is also irrefutable that humans have an impact on earth and our activities do and will influence the planet and atmosphere.  The only arguable point here is how much. I also think it would benefit the climate argument if we broke human influence into two categories, 1. Pollution caused by, I'll call it garbage, our excess waste, things that overload the landfills, leak into our water systems, get left all over the place that devastates animal life, forests, rivers etc. 2. Things we spew into the air, all those smoke stacks spewing all kinds of substances into our atmosphere. And don't demonize Co2. Co2 is a base requirement for life and deserves a more nuanced conversation.

>Despite ongoing deforestation, fires, drought-induced die-offs, and insect outbreaks, the world’s tree cover actually increased by 2.24 million square kilometers — an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined — over the past 35 years, finds a paper published in the journal Nature.

>The research suggests an area covering 2.24 million square kilometers - roughly the combined land surface of Texas and Alaska, two sizeable US states - has been added to global tree cover since 1982. This equates to 7% of the Earth’s surface covered by new trees.

The problem is the decoration is occurring in specific areas. Those areas, are specifically poor places. Because as usual economic success is better for the planet.

What I try to pay attention to are the trends presented as empirical data, not stories in the news. They skew our perceptions and lead to hyperbole like ""the world is on fire"". There is no news article about record low wildfire seasons in a given country. So we focus on Canada, where we get all the headlines about wildfire and climate change this year. But unless climate change is limited to Canada we need to consider global trends, with magnitude and frequency as you say. Like this: [https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145421/building-a-long-term-record-of-fire](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145421/building-a-long-term-record-of-fire).

There is no doubt that the earth is getting warmer. Here we have good reliable global data demonstrating this fact clearly. But we don't have good empirical data showing that wildfires, floods and hurricanes are getting worse.

That's a very poor basis for drawing conclusions about Canadian wildfire frequency and intensity, let alone global. I mean, the numbers are there, you can look at them and see if the facts match your perceptions.

I know and I'm not debating that. I even wrote in my previous comment that there is no doubt that the earth is getting warmer. Not sure why you bring that up.

Absolutely not. Quite the contrary. [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/key-crop-yields](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/key-crop-yields).

>The northern part of Pakistan is considered as a water tower for Pakistan since it comprises one of the world’s largest reserves of snow and ice outside the polar regions6,7,8. This part of the country provides water downstream for agriculture, hydropower generation, drinking and other purposes to the 5th most populous country of the world9,10. This region is more vulnerable to climate change as compared to the other parts of the country11,12,13,14. With the increase of 1 °C in mean summer temperature can increase the river flow by 16–17% in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) and show the sensitivity of glaciers and snow melt in this region15. In recent studies researchers explored that in various parts of African countries and Pakistan, which are considered as climate change hotspots, anticipated changes in the heatwave frequency will affect the population16,17,18,19. Ullah et al.20 concluded that the exposure of the South Asian population to heatwaves is increasing in the future under the shared socioeconomic scenarios during the twenty-first century, however, the northern part of Pakistan is unaffected presently. Lutz et al.21 found out that climate change indicators under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 show that the region may face strong adverse impacts of climate change for the hydropower production, occurrence of floods, human health, and agricultural production in the future.


>The Indus River provides 44% of the water for irrigation and other purposes annually29,30. It contributes 86% in summer season and 14% during winter season. Hydropower contributes 35% to the national electricity grid of Pakistan, where the Indus River itself contributes 79% at present and is expected to contribute 81% in the future27. This includes new hydropower projects with a capacity of at least 50 MW planned by Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)27. Due to the significant contribution of Indus River in terms of water and hydropower, naturally the question arises that what will be the situation about its water availability. This study aims to quantify the available water using different parameterizations of the Tarbela Reservoir in the UIB under a changing climate. In addition, the response of Tarbela reservoir is also assessed under the considered climate change scenarios.","Goodbye, snowy winters?

JustJay613,Urkern,"It's tricky. We recognize climate change but have to be careful pinning everything on it. That's what the naysayers will always point out.

I just did a quick exercise with Ottawa, Canada and Remembrance Day.

1950 - +4.1
1970 - +12.4
1990 - +1.2
2010 - +9.7
2019 - - 4.5
2020 - +19.6
2021 - +7.0
2022 - +17.0
2023 - +1.0

So randomly picking a day and then every 20 years since the records started in 1950 until more recent years you can draw any conclusions about anything. 2019 was the coldest then this year. External influences like El Nino are at work.
Part of the reason the whole thing flipped from Global Warming to Climate Change. Things are happening but there is a lot of ""data"" that can contradict and that only arms the clowns.

Marc_Op,Tliish,">the models are off in relation to the rate of change

Is there any scientific consensus about the models being off?

In 1988, Hansen et al. intermediate scenario B gave about +1.4C warming in 2020 (+1.1C with respect to 1960). Considering all the variables and uncertainties when looking 32 years into the future, I think they got the rate quite accurately.

See Fig.3: [https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988\_Hansen\_ha02700w.pdf](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Hansen_ha02700w.pdf)",Is the rate of change off because cities as heat islands aren't factored in?,"Does anyone know if any of the climate change models includes cities as permanent heat sources?

It is a well-known fact that cities retain daytime heat and release it at night, maintaining local temperatures a few degrees above the surrounding terrain. As temperatures rise, the amount of heat trapped by cities must also go up, and be retained longer. So I'm wondering if that is one of reasons the models are off in relation to the rate of change. The numbers of cities and towns across the globe are immense, and if they are trapping and releasing heat on a daily cycle, in increasing amounts, do the models include them as feedback heat sources?

bdginmo,Tliish,"The effect is small mainly because the percentage of surface area is relatively small as well. Even using Dr. Spencer's (a well known climate ""skeptic"") [new UHI dataset](https://www.drroyspencer.com/2023/11/a-new-global-urban-heat-island-dataset-global-grids-of-the-urban-heat-island-effect-on-air-temperature-1800-2023/) I estimated only a 0.02-0.04 C effect from 1800 to present which is insignificant compared to the approximately 1.4 C in temperature.

But to answer your question it is yes and no. Some models do consider it and some don't. Land use changes are tricky because they are a double edged sword. While urban areas do contribute to heating both in terms of lowering the albedo and waste heat the agricultural areas contribute to cooling mainly through increased evapotranspiration suppressing daily high temperatures. You don't see a lot of discussion regarding the later in the mainstream media or contrarian blogosphere despite it being a well known and heavily researched topic.

The other thing to keep in mind is that the UHI bias (which is different from the effect itself) is often mitigated by removing the effect. The thought is that if we remove the effect itself then its potential to contaminate spatial averages is also mitigated. This comes at the potential cost of underestimating the actual warming rate. Though as I mentioned above the effect isn't significant so removing it from consideration probably isn't having a significant effect on the global average temperature anyway.

Most of the disparity between prediction and reality is confined to localized regions.  For example, models overestimate the warming rate in the interior of the US. This is primarily the result of models not adequately handling land use changes in the agriculture regions or just simply not using land use (agricultural intensification) inputs at all.

Well I don't know why you are asking again because you will get the same explanation as before. Two degrees F is not existential and no one has ever said that. So I don't know why you keep repeating that statement. 5-9F may well be existential to civilization which is what is being projected.

- current global average is 59F/15C (13.6C baseline + 1.4C)
- forget 1850-1900 for a moment & consider that the current 59F is not causing all the issues CC folks claim. Sky isn't falling.
- add 2 degrees Fahrenheit to 59F & you get 60.98F which is not a huge change, either, especially since about half that average is a warmer winter!
- 60.98F/16.1C correlates to 2.5C above the 1850-2000 baseline of 13.6C/56.5F.
- yes, 60.98/16.1C is about 4.5F higher than the 56.5F baseline. My point is the baseline 1850-1900 is an irrelevant sales goal that was agreed upon 
just to get everyone on the same page
- all that matters is that no huge climate changes will occur going from the current 59F average to an equally liveable 60.98 global average...especially since half the change will be a degree warmer winter

Tpaine63,Tliish,"It would be very helpful if you did not use actual temperatures. It just confuses the issue and there is no agreement since that would take into account the temperatures throughout the atmosphere. What we do have is a very good idea of the average surface temperature for the past 140 years. And from that, we have a good idea of the changes from some baseline within that 140 years.  Also if centigrade could be used instead of Fahrenheit since scientific reports use the metric system it would also be helpful and prevent confusion. Since often anomalies are given relative to preindustrial temperatures, like the often cited 1.5C or 2C, that is what I'm going to use.

Pielke and Happer have their opinion on what they think is impossible which is not what the vast majority of climate scientists are saying. But it is just that, an opinion since they have no evidence of that because no one knows how much CO2 we will put in the atmosphere or if we will hit or have already hit some tipping points whether you think that can happen or not. What we do know for a fact is that by projecting CO2 increases that have been happening for the past 63 years into the future we would have 689 ppm in 2100 which would produce about 3.6C of warming above preindustrial temperatures.

Honest_Cynic,Tliish,"That effect has been studied.  There was a slight discrepancy thru \~2000 between ground measurements and satellites, but I recall it was resolved as not due to a heat-island effect, plus corrections have been made for urban expansion.

A related issue is adding new temperature stations or relocating existing ones, say from a grassy area to asphalt.  As with CO2 ground measurements, windy days probably give a better spatially-averaged measurement.  I ran across a web post by a climate skeptic which analyzed data for California over the last century.  He claimed to have found that 4 new weather stations had been added, and all of them were in the hotter deserts of E. California, and simply added to the average.  When he removed that data, it showed no warming trend.  But, I saw no follow-up, so perhaps his suspicion proved unfounded.  It surely would have been a rookie mistake.  Even if true, unlikely purposeful since the last station was added in the early 1960's before global warming was much concern.

Another issue is if energy usage in urban areas significantly raises local air temperature.  All energy use, both fossil fuels and electricity turns into heat added to the air and land.  A fairly simple lumped-parameter model might estimate the effect, including hot air rising upward and wind passing new air mass thru.  Perhaps that has been calculated and found negligible.  There is certainly more energy released in today's cities than in 1900 with horses, chillier homes, and much smaller cities.",Is the rate of change off because cities as heat islands aren't factored in?,"Does anyone know if any of the climate change models includes cities as permanent heat sources?

Tliish,Splenda,">Climate change doesn’t cause things like hurricanes or wildfires, but it can make them more intense or more frequent.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/us/national-climate-assessment-extreme-weather-costs/index.html

Buddy, if climate change makes it more frequent, then it *causes* it. 

Statements like this show the disconnect in the minds of a lot of people. Bad weather things are happening with greater frequency due to climate change, but some still persist in the misinformed idea that climate change can't manifest disasters on its own.

I blame the ""by 2100"" metric scientists are so fond of. The public has been assured that nothing really bad will happen until 2100, so everyone *knows* that it will be okay until then, scientists said so themselves. What's another storm or two every year? Time enough to worry about climate change in 2090.

Yeah, I know, that's not what they were saying. But that's what everyone was *hearing,* partly because they wanted to, partly because they don't share the same language or worldviews with scientists.

Charts aren't much help. Most people can't read them, and those who can in the business community don't interpret them properly. Their business conditioning leads them to scan charts quickly, not study and interpret them, and they are conditioned to see rising slopes as good things, not bad. So even when they stop and actually pay attention to them, their gut instincts are ""up"" is good, offsetting whatever their brain is telling them.

What scientists see as clear and dispassionate proof of looming disaster demanding immediate action, delivered in a calm professional manner with footnotes and citations is received by the public as droning blah, blah, chart, blah, chart...*booorrriiinnnggg! Wake me up in 2090, lol!*

talkshow57,Splenda,"So here is a reference that reviews Holocene temperature variance.  

http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/fall16/atmo336/lectures/sec5/holocene.html

It seems clear that rapid, significant global temperature change was/is part of our current epoch.

Four of the prior five interglacials had maximum temperatures that were as high or higher than current. This is known, peer reviewed science.

Any chart that uses a baseline of 1850-1900, a period of time commencing at the tail end of the LIA, when global temperatures were just departing from their coldest point in thousands of years, is the cherriest of cherry picking. That 1850-1900 is also coincident with the advent of ‘industrialization’ is just that, a coincidence.

What is not a coincidence is the sudden explosion of human well being that started about that same time, with that correspondence continuing on in to our modern age.

World population in 1850 - 1.2 billion
Poverty rate in 1850 - approx 80%

I could go on and on, and on…. literally every single metric that one can measure human success by was terrible. Life was short, brutish, and very tough before the 1800’s.

Conversely, let’s look at 2023 now…
World Population - 8 billion 
World Poverty - approx. 10%

And, as well, virtually every other metric that one can name is infinitely better now than in 1850. In a population orders of magnitude larger.

Humanity has flourished like at no other time before in its history. The vast majority of that success is newly found - happening mostly in the last 40-50 years - the very same time that ‘climate change’ was supposed to be reeking havoc on us.

Negative economic measures of climate change are disingenuous at best. Of course more buildings and businesses and places will suffer from climate related disasters and challenges, there are more of them, in greater densities, in more places. The severity and frequency of such just cannot be fairly compared past to present. To paraphrase - if a tree burned in the forest sometime in the deep past, and there was no one there to smell the smoke, or count the acres burned, did the tree burn? Of course it did, and in numbers that no one today can really discern sufficiently to make comparisons.

I prefer a more humane metric to compare past climate impact to the modern era, that being the actual, empirically derived death toll from ‘natural’ disasters over the last century - 

https://humanprogress.org/the-collapse-of-climate-related-deaths-2/

Somehow the danger from natural disaster has declined by 99% in a much larger, more diversely located population. Now that is some good news, no matter how at odds it may be with what we are being told by IPCC executive summaries and the pundits - the prophets of doom, as it were.

So, here we are, at the pinnacle of human success - at least from a basic proliferation of a species perspective - and then, that’s it… everything we did to achieve this success, the things that allowed the birth of new billions of people, was all a mistake?

Because the sea level might rise a bit? Because it is going to rain a certain percentage more in one place, and less in another. Things that are already happening, just that they are going to happen more….or less, or a bit sooner, or a bit later, or something like that. This is the big existential crisis of our time? Not WWW3?  Not wondering what will happen to the fastest growing populations in the world who all seem to live in places that are not really suited to supporting huge numbers of people? Not wondering why we allow 100’s of thousands to suffer and die every year from respiratory diseases caused by cooking and heating fires - instead of providing cheap, available, fossil fueled electrical service. Nope - CO2 is the beast which must be tamed. Amazing shit really.

In the interglacial prior to ours sea levels were up to 5 meters higher than today. During our most recent glacial maximum, 13500-16000 years ago, sea level was 150 meters lower than today. PS - that glaciation lasted 100k years or so.

The world has been doing crazy climate stuff for ever - claiming that the speed or frequency of the crazy stuff is the issue, based on rather subjective modeling and tortured facts, and in some cases ‘low to moderate confidence’ attribution data is the ultimate boondoggle.

The critique of economic growth as fundamentally opposed to environmental goals is reductionist. It overlooks the potential of economic development to fund sustainable innovation and build resilience against climate impacts. The article also simplistically correlates economic activity with environmental degradation, disregarding the complex interplay of factors that drive ecological impact.
  

  
Furthermore, the reliance on consensus as a means to validate the climate emergency narrative undermines the essence of scientific inquiry, which is rooted in skepticism and ongoing debate.

“Economic growth, as it is conventionally pursued, is unlikely to allow us to achieve our social, climate, and biodiversity goals. The fundamental challenge lies in the difficulty of decoupling economic growth from harmful environmental impacts (figure 5a). Although technological advancements and efficiency improvements can contribute to some degree of decoupling, they often fall short in mitigating the overall ecological footprint of economic activities (Hickel et al. 2021).”

Consensus is the standard way science moves forward. It doesn’t stop science from being based in skepticism or debate. Do we actually debate if the earth is round or the theory of relativity? As evidence builds consensus develops. It’s actually this slow conservative approach that’s kept science from really telling us what the risks are. If you want to introduce more debate on a topic you need evidence to cause the consensus to be questioned.

mulletator,Splenda,"
In the history of science, there have been numerous occasions where the prevailing consensus was eventually proven wrong. The geocentric model of the universe, which stood unchallenged for centuries, is a prime example. It was the norm to believe that Earth was at the universe's center until the Copernican heliocentrism model proved otherwise. Similarly, the phlogiston theory in chemistry, which posited an element in combustible materials released during burning, was widely accepted until disproved by the discovery of oxygen. In the medical field, the consensus that ulcers were caused by factors like stress or spicy food was upended when it was discovered that the Helicobacter pylori bacterium was a primary cause. These examples underscore how scientific consensus, though often valuable, is not infallible.
  



  
Turning to the topic of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been a central figure in shaping the global understanding and response. However, the IPCC's approach and conclusions have not been without controversy. Critics argue that the IPCC reports have sometimes contained errors and overstatements, raising questions about objectivity and the potential influence of non-scientific factors. The Climategate scandal, involving leaked emails from climate scientists, further fueled skepticism. It suggested a possibility of exaggerating the case for anthropogenic climate change and suppressing dissenting views. While no evidence of fraud was found, such incidents have undeniably tarnished the public perception of climate science.
  



  
Moreover, the relationship between media portrayal and political rhetoric on climate change often goes beyond scientific evidence. This can lead to an atmosphere where climate policies are driven more by alarmism and political agendas rather than a sober assessment of data. In some instances, the urgency and crisis narrative pushed forward doesn't fully align with the more nuanced, complex understanding that many climate scientists themselves hold.
  



  
It's essential to approach the climate change debate with a critical lens, recognizing that while anthropogenic factors do play a role in climate change, the extent, impact, and solutions are far from settled. The data and models used to predict future climate scenarios have limitations and uncertainties that must be acknowledged. This critique does not seek to invalidate the efforts of climate scientists but rather to advocate for a more measured, evidence-based approach to understanding and addressing climate change, free from the distortions of political agendas and alarmism.",2023 state of the climate report: Life on planet Earth is under siege.

oldwhiteguy35,Splenda,"The consensuses you list are low resolution theories that fell quickly after more evidence was collected. Comparing these to modern, extremely well supported (by evidence) scientific theories is a bit ridiculous. “AGW is over 125 years old. It’s based on bed rock physics and direct measurements in the real world. It’s been challenged numerous times and only become stronger. There is currently zero reasons to suspect the current consensus will be overturned as there isn’t anything solid even challenging it.

The “critics” of the IPCC you speak of are almost exclusively fossil fuel funded pseudo skeptics. The others have never managed to demonstrate any real issues. Yes, IPCC reports have had some errors but never on anything significant or in an area that would drive policy. A few minor errors in such a massive document isn’t a real critique. And when anyone brings up “climategate” I know they really aren’t legitimate skeptics. That propaganda exercise that involved quote mining a few snippets to attempt to discredit climate science was absolutely transparent to those who looked at the context. But yes, it did create distrust but only by manipulating the uninformed. Something propaganda mills are designed to do. It can’t be helped. There’s too much money in maintaining the status quo.

The media has finally caught up to the science. Gone are the false balance etc… except of course from media sources still trying to deny the science. The extent of our impact, btw, is massive. It’s most likely 100% of the observed warming in the past 70 years is us. Even more if we factor in the cooling impacts we’ve also had via aerosols.

When the stakes are they are we can’t say the addressing the most likely scenario can wait because of uncertainty.

mulletator,Splenda,"Your stance on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) and the associated consensus is overly confident and dismissive of valid critiques. To categorically label all critics of the IPCC as ""fossil fuel funded pseudo skeptics"" is not only an oversimplification but a clear bias. It's crucial in scientific discourse to confront the substance of the arguments, not just their perceived source. Such dismissal is a tactic to avoid engaging with legitimate scientific inquiries and differing interpretations of data within the climate science community.


  

  
Your claim that AGW is based on ""bedrock physics"" oversimplifies a vastly more complex reality. While the basic principles of the greenhouse effect are well-understood, the application to climate change involves multifaceted models with inherent uncertainties. These uncertainties, particularly concerning feedback mechanisms and long-term projections, are significant. To equate the current understanding of AGW with fundamental laws of physics is to ignore these complexities and uncertainties. It's a form of intellectual overreach that doesn't do justice to the nuanced and evolving nature of climate science.


  

  
The assertion that there's ""zero reason to suspect the current consensus will be overturned"" reflects a misunderstanding of how science operates. History is replete with examples of scientific consensuses overturned by new evidence and perspectives. To declare AGW theory as immune to revision is not only scientifically unsound but also an arrogant dismissal of the principle of continuous scientific inquiry and skepticism.


  

  
Regarding ""climategate,"" your characterization of it as mere propaganda is a disservice to the critical need for transparency and rigorous data handling in science. This incident, while not negating the science of climate change, highlighted significant issues in the climate research community that warrant attention, not dismissal.


  

  
Lastly, your approach to uncertainty in climate predictions is dangerously one-sided. Focusing solely on the most alarming scenarios while ignoring the possibility that impacts might be less severe is an unbalanced and potentially misleading strategy. It's imperative in scientific policy-making to consider a full range of scenarios, including those where climate change impacts are more moderate. This is not just a matter of prudence but a fundamental aspect of responsible scientific and policy planning.

I’ve looked at the claims… listened to opposing positions. You know, like an actual skeptic. There isn’t one that stands up.

AGW is based on the fundamental laws of physics. Will our understanding become better as we learn more? Absolutely. Is the entire theory going to be flipped? Highly unlikely. Just like evolution, relativity, germ theory, we’re in the refinement stage. The nuance and evolving nature exists but we don’t have time to wait and we’ve no valid reason to doubt that climate change is a major threat. You point to uncertainty but I’ll remind you that uncertainty goes both ways. Plus feedbacks seem to be occurring as expected. 

Rather than pointing to past times where science turned on new evidence (which were never as well supported as AGW) why not point to a relevant precedent. Not some early version based on extremely limited understanding or a recent example that was new and always controversial (ulcers) but something on the scale of evolution. AGW isn’t immune to revision but with so much evidence for and no real alternatives you’d seek to paralyze us from any form of decision making. Just one more study he asks for.

There was nothing of any value whatsoever that came from Climategate. We know who perpetrated it and how it was politically deployed to disrupt the Copenhagen summit. What benefits were gained? What was learned? The most seems to have been that Phil Jones has a bad temper. Most people who cite the emails don’t even understand what was said. It was absolutely a propaganda ploy and your attempts to present it as legitimate concerns shows your bias and lack of skepticism.

And the uncertainty paragraph betrays your biases again. Im not focused on the “most alarming”. I’m focused on the most likely. Uncertainty swings both ways from that.

While the greenhouse effect plays a crucial role in AGW, it's not accurate to describe it as a principle of physics in the same vein as the laws of thermodynamics or Newton's laws of motion. The greenhouse effect involves a series of processes, including the absorption and re-radiation of energy within the Earth's atmosphere, which are influenced by a multitude of variables.


  

  
In my field of geophysics, we deal with the intricacies of Earth's systems, and this perspective is crucial when considering climate models.

This shortfall is significant because it tests the models' ability to replicate known climate patterns, which is essential for validating their future projections.


  

  
Furthermore, the reliance on ensembles of models to predict climate outcomes points to the inherent uncertainties in our understanding. No single model can encompass the entire complexity of the Earth's climate system, necessitating the use of multiple models to capture a range of possibilities. This approach reveals the uncertainty in predicting exact climate futures, making it clear that our grasp on these processes, while substantial, is not absolute.


  

  
The modeling of feedback mechanisms – like the role of clouds, ocean currents, and ice albedo – adds another layer of complexity. These factors are crucial in shaping the Earth's climate response but are among the least understood and most difficult to accurately represent in climate models. Misrepresentations or inaccuracies in modeling these feedbacks can significantly skew the projections.

Lol… AGW (Anthropogenic Global Warming) is produced by the laws of thermodynamics. Gases absorb and reemit at particular wavelengths and transfer energy to other gases via collisions. It’s fundamental. Other variables don’t really matter. More CO2 (or CH4,etc) and the energy balance of the atmosphere is altered. AGW is simply a fact. One that’s been measured directly.

mulletator,Splenda,"The assertion that AGW (Anthropogenic Global Warming) is a direct and straightforward result of the laws of thermodynamics, while technically true, oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors influencing our climate. Indeed, gases absorb and reemit energy at particular wavelengths, and more greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4 alter the energy balance of the atmosphere. However, to claim that ""other variables don't really matter"" is to ignore the immense complexity of Earth's climate system.


  

  
While it's undeniable that the physical laws govern the basic processes, this does not automatically translate into predictable, linear outcomes, especially in a system as intricate as Earth's climate. Think of it akin to the way physics governs the outcome of a bicycle race. While the basic principles of physics undeniably influence the race - such as the aerodynamics, the power output of the cyclists, and the friction between tires and road - predicting the winner involves far more variables. These include the cyclists' strategies, their physical conditions, and even unpredictable factors like weather or accidents. Just as it would be overly simplistic to predict the outcome of a bicycle race based solely on the laws of physics, it is overly simplistic to make definitive claims about the future of our climate based solely on the greenhouse gas concentrations.


  

  
The statement that AGW is ""simply a fact"" measured directly and that the Earth is warming as expected also glosses over the notable uncertainties and errors in climate models. These models, while useful, are not infallible predictors. They are limited by our current understanding and the quality of historical data inputs. As a geophysicist, I place significant importance on the geological record, which shows that Earth's climate has undergone many changes over millions of years due to various natural factors. This long-term perspective is often missing in the current climate discourse, which tends to focus on shorter-term data and modeling predictions.  


In the climate change discourse, both alarmist and overly skeptical positions often neglect important facts, leading to polarized and unproductive discussions. It's essential to remember that the ends don't always justify the means. While addressing carbon emissions is undoubtedly important, the strategies we adopt must be realistically grounded in a thorough understanding of climate science and its socio-economic impacts.


  

  
Proposing extreme measures without considering their feasibility or the broader implications can be as detrimental as denying the need for action. For instance, my support for modern nuclear reactors over intermittent renewables like wind and solar is based on their proven efficiency, reliability, and lower environmental impact when considering factors like land use.

They don't matter regarding AGW. We've added CO2. CO2 does its thing. We create a warming effect. Now, do these other variables matter regarding how climate change will occur? Of course they do, but that doesn't alter the physics of AGW. Therefore. AGW is simply a fact. 

And of course, there are masses of studies that have looked at other potential causes of warming and found that there really isn't a case for anything else than human influences after 1950. 

You also note that how exactly the climate system responds is still far from certain. There are certainly some specific and local reactions that will have to wait until we know more. However, the big response of decarbonization is a no brainer. Keeping the system from changing as much as possible is prudent.

>For instance, my support for modern nuclear reactors over intermittent renewables like wind and solar is based on their proven efficiency, reliability, and lower environmental impact when considering factors like land use.

This is where your argument takes a weird turn as this policy choice isn't affected by any of the uncertainties you keep speaking of. It's simply part of the discussion about how to decarbonize rather than if we should. The irony is that your position is an oversimplification and an unnecessary foray into a rigid binary. I've no issue with building nuclear as a baseload source. Some doubt we need it, but if we do move forward relying solely on it is bad policy. It's too expensive and too slow to deploy. We should be charging ahead with deployment of renewables with storage and then adding nuclear once it's ready.

The feasibility of these solutions have been considered. It's dishonest to act as if they haven't.

>Ultimately, the path we choose in responding to climate change should be informed, balanced, and sustainable. It's not just about achieving a low-carbon future; it's about doing so in a way that is economically viable, socially responsible, and scientifically sound.

Sorry, but without viable carbon capture (not on the horizon) there is no balanced if we don't see decarbonization as the necessary goal. 
Economically viable is also a vague and meaningless phrase to throw out without specifics. The economic consensus on climate change seems to be the cost of action is sustainable and viable.

At no time in an interglacial has the rate of temperature increase been above 0.5C per century, the rate for the last 40 years is 2.1C per century",2023 state of the climate report: Life on planet Earth is under siege. We are now in uncharted territory.,,2023-11-15 23:46:42
mulletator,Splenda,"The comparison between temperature changes observed in the current era and those inferred from paleoclimatic data during interglacial periods must account for the differences in the granularity and precision of these measurements.
  

  
Paleoclimatic data, derived from sources like ice cores, tree rings, and sediment deposits, provides invaluable insights into Earth's historical climate patterns, including those during interglacial periods. However, these records offer a relatively coarse resolution. They capture broad trends over long timescales – often spanning hundreds to thousands of years – but lack the finer granularity to detect rapid or short-term temperature fluctuations. This limitation in resolution means that while we can confidently assert that temperature changes during past interglacials were generally gradual, it's challenging to accurately compare these rates to modern measurements.
  

  
In contrast, modern temperature measurements are far more granular and precise. With advanced technologies and a global network of weather stations, satellites, and ocean buoys, contemporary climate data provides a detailed view of temperature changes, often on the scale of days or even hours. This high-resolution data shows that the rate of temperature increase in recent decades – approximately 2.1°C per century over the last 40 years – is notably fast compared to the more gradual changes suggested by paleoclimatic records.
  

  
The key point here is the difficulty in directly comparing these two sets of data. The apparent rapidity of recent warming, as accurately captured by modern instruments, stands in contrast to the slower rates of change inferred from paleoclimatic data. However, this contrast doesn't necessarily imply a climate emergency or suggest that life on Earth is ""under siege."" Rather, it highlights the unique nature of the current climate situation, driven significantly by human activities, in the context of Earth's long-term natural climate history.
  

  
Understanding this distinction is crucial. While recognizing the accelerated pace of recent climate change and its link to anthropogenic factors, it's also important to consider these changes within the broader, long-term narrative of Earth's climate. This perspective advocates for a balanced, informed approach to climate policy, focusing on sustainable and adaptive strategies that address both human-induced and natural climate factors. It suggests a view of climate change as a significant yet gradual process, emphasizing thoughtful, long-term responses over immediate alarm.",2023 state of the climate report: Life on planet Earth is under siege.

Seven day forecast are 80% of the time which is a thousand times better than a century ago.

PlacerGold,Tpaine63,"The claim that no part of the U.S. is safe from climate disasters is clearly  an overgeneralization. While it's true that climate change can increase the frequency or intensity of certain weather events, to suggest that every area is equally at risk ignores the complex and varied geographical and climatic realities across the United States. A more nuanced approach would consider regional variations and acknowledge areas where the impacts might be less severe or different in nature.
  

  
Secondly, the article relies heavily on the findings of the Fifth National Climate Assessment and the field of attribution science, which aims to link specific events to climate change. While attribution science has made advances, it's important to maintain a critical perspective. There are inherent limitations and uncertainties in attributing individual weather events to climate change, especially given the complexity of Earth's climate system and the influence of natural variability.
  

  
Regarding the economic impacts mentioned in the article, it's crucial to balance these concerns with the understanding that economic models predicting future climate-related costs are based on a range of assumptions and projections. These models can vary significantly in their predictions, and they often struggle to account for potential technological advancements or adaptive measures that might mitigate these costs.
  

  
The article also emphasizes the urgency of cutting planet-warming pollution to meet international climate goals. While reducing emissions is undoubtedly important, it's also necessary to explore and discuss the feasibility and effectiveness of different approaches. The focus on renewable energy sources like wind and solar, often advocated in mainstream discussions, might not be sufficient or reliable enough to meet global energy demands. This is where alternative solutions, such as modern nuclear reactors, could play a critical role, offering a more stable and efficient source of low-carbon energy.
  

  
In conclusion, while the article sheds light on important issues related to climate change, it is essential to approach these topics with a critical eye, considering the complexities, uncertainties, and the potential for diverse solutions beyond the mainstream narrative.","No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe | CNN",,2023-11-14 18:38:08

It clearly stated that more than once.

> There are inherent limitations and uncertainties in attributing individual weather events to climate change, especially given the complexity of Earth's climate system and the influence of natural variability.

Of course there are as in every field of science. And the reports state that and the amount of uncertainties.

I live here and all I recall is forest fires, which are dubiously tied to climate change.  In drought years, they say risk increases from dry timber.  In wet years, they say that builds up undergrowth which later dries out to increase fire risk.  So, either way they blame all fires on climate.

Fig 1.8 shows the flaky statistics commonly used to argue climate impacts.  I see no trend in the plots which look like a shotgun blast, yet they fit (imagine?) a trend line to argue that poor people suffer more heat.

Your opinion of 'Environmental justice' is between you and your conscience. It has nothing to do with climate change or climate change science. I would have thought the moderators would have removed that comment.

brickyardjimmy,Splenda,"Let's say, for argument's sake, that the dire projections of climatologists are accurate.

​

I think, if that's the case, we're in an all-out emergency. A big end of the world action movie. Only we're a little soft on the action part of this action movie. If anything, the human race still has yet to cross the threshold of the story of climate change. We haven't come to a consensus that it even exists as a problem. The free market is not the machine for that emergency. If anything, the free market is set up to stall action on climate change. I think it's not an exaggeration to say that many different global industries and businesses have worked hard to delay action on climate change and to obfuscate the alarming conclusions many scientists are desperately trying to get everyone to notice.

​

The free market  has worked very well for us in the past. As you mentioned. But an economic system based solely on growth--a *consumer* oriented growth across all categories of business and industry--just isn't set up for the kind of unified action that's needed. If, that is, you're to believe the experts, many of whom are saying that we are in a war against time whether we want to be or not.

​

I think you'd need an economy that is squarely aimed at climate change so that people can continue to build reasonable fortunes and so that everyone has work...maybe even *has* to work. By work--I just mean this might be an all hands on deck sort of emergency. If we can start offering meaningful pay for climate change work, at all levels, maybe we'd have a chance of beating back the worst of scientist's visions for our relatively immediate future.

​

I don't know if those predictions are true. I don't know they're not either. But some of those projections are so grim that, if they're remotely accurate, we are facing a global calamity within the scope of our lifetime. The free market is not capable of meeting that challenge in that timeline without some hardcore visionary governance. To me.",$266 Trillion in Climate Spending Is a No-Brainer.

The chart in this graph is what I'm referring to with confidence in specific weather related changes. 

Many things are being observed, but haven't had confident ties to man made climate change. 

Take tropical cyclone activity for example. Activity has increased in the Atlantic the past few decades. Waters are also warmer. Slam dunk. Easy case, obvious human influence, right?

Then why has Western Pacific activity *decreased*? Waters have warmed there as well.

Still a lot of work remains to grasp a full understanding of our extremely complex and dynamic climate. 

I've been focusing on climate because that's what this sub is about. 

But as much doubt as I've been casting on certain aspects of climate that we don't understand too well, long term economic outlooks are far, FAR worse, to the point of offering next to no valuable insight whatsoever.

Mixing the two together for a very distant long term outlook is a recipe for disaster. The study behind this whole thread does exactly that.

barrenroad,Splenda,"A [Carbon Fee and Dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend) scheme consists of taxing co2 production at the point of production, and then redistributing that money equally amongst all citizens. The effect of the policy is that the cost increases from taxes on co2 production are passed on to consumers, but consumers also then receive an ""average"" amount of money back. It is then up to them whether they want to spend that money on the now more expensive polluting endeavors, or whether they want to spend their money elsewhere.

Such a scheme exists in Canada and Switzerland. Its implementation in the US is supported by hundreds of economists as well as all living ex-Fed chairs. If implemented in the US, it is thought that it will lower co2 production in the US by 50% in 10 years.

Straight from ChatGPT:

“The lower carbon footprints of Norway and Sweden compared to Canada can be attributed to several factors. Both Norway and Sweden have invested significantly in renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, wind energy, and in the case of Sweden, substantial contributions from nuclear power. These nations also have more compact populations and efficient public transportation systems, reducing reliance on individual vehicles.

Furthermore, Norway benefits from a substantial share of its energy production coming from hydropower, and it has been a pioneer in the adoption of electric vehicles. Sweden has a comprehensive approach to sustainability, with policies promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency.

In contrast, Canada's higher carbon footprint is influenced by its vast land area, dispersed population, and a significant reliance on resource-intensive industries, including the extraction of oil and gas from tar sands. Transportation challenges in such a large country also contribute to higher per capita carbon emissions.”

Individual consumers in Canada do not have control over resource extraction, and we shouldn’t be punished for the difficulties of living in this country. That’s why the carbon tax isn’t working here, because people see through the bullshit. Per capita is a shit metric to measure carbon pollution, and it conveniently ignores the realities people have to deal with on a daily basis.

barrenroad,Splenda,"actually, believe it or not, the primary advocate of carbon taxes has been an economist named Gregory Mankiw. He's a conservative economist and Harvard professor, and was W.'s economic advisor.

The general view among economists is that carbon taxes are the least invasive and most efficient way to deal with the issue, because by modeling a price to carbon generation, it's no longer some nebulous externality, and rational actors in a capitalist system can respond to its societal cost.

Initial attempts to push through a carbon tax were generally considered regressive (if basic goods like food and gas go up, poor people feel the effect more), so current attempts to pass one have been more progressive, like this carbon fee and dividend scheme. Economists generally agree that ANY type of carbon tax would work...this is just a more progressive version. 

Importantly, carbon taxes start really low - like 10-15 dollars per ton of co2, and ramp slowly and predictably over a number of years. Because of this, the wealthy have time to adapt (buy an EV, put up solar panels, buy a heat pump, etc). So, no one's really worried about the unfortunate wealthy who will be out in the cold due to the nanny state - or whatever. 

For reference, I just put up solar panels last year, I'll buy an EV in about a month, and I hope to have a heat pump put in next year. The up-front cost was non-trivial, and I was fortunate enough to be able to pay it. But, it's a financial boon to me, because with all the incentives, etc, my time to payoff for everything is somewhere in the range of 4 years...at the end of which I'll be saving something like 13k a year.

Astro_Joe_97,Memetic1,"Talks about pulling carbon out of the atmosphere, while we're still pumping record levels of carbon in the atmosphere every year, makes little to no sense. It's like using a cleaning mop to battle sea level rise. 

I agree that nuclear is very much necessary if we don't want a complete worst case scenario. I'm not informed enough about the kind you talk about, but it sound great. I'm highly sceptical tho, we have time to wait for future technology to save us. Given that 2°C of warming by about 2050 is already locked in, as the most recent science is saying. And 2 degrees almost guarantees tipping points being passed. I don't want to spread a mindset of ""its too late, why bother"", as every tenth of a degree matters. But the world needs a wake up call asap.",Climate tipping points could be triggered by 'committed warming',,2023-11-15 16:57:12
Pestus613343,Memetic1,"This nuclear technology isn't new actually, we've known how to do it since the 1970s.  For various business, military reasons not to mention sunk cost fallacies, it was not pursued and abandoned.  Right now plenty of start up companies are trying to get it together, but are mired in a regulatory hell where the govt insists on perfection before they even do an experiment, but can't do an experiment to figure out what perfection will be.   It's a hurry up and wait situation that may resolve itself in a few short years.

The chemistry isn't new either.  It's things the oil industry have been routinely doing for many years.   Most of those processes aren't cost effective to do though as you're burning fossil fuels in order to do oceanic or atmospheric processing.  It's pointless, so they don't do it.   However, cracking, hydrocarbon synthesis, hydrogen production, desalination, and a host of other things are basically what the oil industry is good at.   If you derived heat from a reactor rather than from burning natural gas, you could do all of that without carbon cost and suddenly entire new business models become viable.

Then there's the real magic..  If you're able to synthesize net-negative hydrocarbons from the carbon cycle, you can then derive all the various combustible fuel products.  Gasoline, Kerosene, Diesel, etc.  Thus anything an internal combustion car burns becomes 100% carbon neutral.  Suddenly the costs of renovating our global infrastructure drops massively.   One might argue an internal combustion vehicle might be less of a carbon footprint than an electric car, in that scenario.  

You're also right that it will be too late, because no one seems even aware these approaches are available.  Meanwhile environmentalists are still pushing renewables tech which is rather weak, even if better than fossil fuels.  You *still* have green political parties being anti nuclear, which is self destructive.

If you want to know more about this different approach to nuclear, look up ""Molten Salt Reactors"".   Also inaccurately described in the media as ""Thorium reactors""",Climate tipping points could be triggered by 'committed warming',,2023-11-15 18:15:03
Astro_Joe_97,Memetic1,"Thanks for the explenation! I have heard of thorium reactors before, but didn't know the details. Yeah the fossil fuel industry probably doesn't want it to succeed you'd think. Kinda similar to how hemp plant could be used for a tremendous amount of things, the fibers alone could replace large parts of the pollutive plastic industry. But as with everything with humans, the most important thing is always; is it profitable? A mentality that is self destructive. I wouldn't bet on the widespread development of these things for this exact reason, but one can surely hope!",Climate tipping points could be triggered by 'committed warming',,2023-11-16 10:02:58
Pestus613343,Memetic1,"I hang out in forums with nuclear engineers.  I am a layman who's simply fetishized this technology over many years.  What I find funny is they are as conservative and business focused as anyone.  Some even mock environmentalism but admit that because their solutions are superior its a good place to focus marketing lol.

The oil industry is tied to the refining business.  When extraction is unprofitable they raise rates on refined goods. So they could be partners in this if convinced.  They could renovate and still make their money, staying in business for the long term.  Unfortunately they fund many of the anti nuclear activism groups while also funding renewables deployments.  This is because they see nuclear as the real competition and renewables as the useful idiot.  Renewables grids are unworkable without non existent battery technology so end up being natural gas peaker grids.

There is a business case here.  Load following electrical generators, and unlike existing nuclear power plants, tons of secondary business models.  There's enough backing in investment but the main hurdle is actually regulators struggling to understand this technology, slowing it down.  In the US the nuclear regulator has been acused of being infiltrated by anti nuclear activists.  I cant quantify that claim but their sluggishness and obstructionism is evident.  The public would need to pressure government that this should be a higher priority.

SlackerInCharge,Memetic1,"It's an interesting situation and it is dividing the country. Since we are discussing the real world and not fantasy we have to discuss how much of Canada lives... North American homes a large, they tend to have large rooms, often open plan and non-insulated internal walls, that's important, they have well-insulated external walls and heating in the basement. The heating tends to be oil or gas based. It's cheap and works and is reliable. The temp outside in much of Canada is -20c in the winter, heat pumps stop working at very low temps, if you are reliant on electricity you might die. The carbon taxes in this case end up being just a tax on heating. One example is my father-in-law. He lives by himself, he will not move voluntarily. He heats with gas and something like 60% of his bill in the winter is carbon tax. We are talking maybe 200-300$ per month. He hates this tax. Guess how he'll vote. Solutions?

That would mean a bill of $250 per month with the carbon tax vs $156 without it. So those 5 months of winter cost an extra $470. 

The carbon tax refunds range from $368 (NB - and he's not in New Brunswick if he's using natural gas) to $772 (AB) per year depending what province he's in. If he's married or is a single parent, the rebate is $552 - $1158 per year. A family of 4 would get $736 - $1544 per year.

LackmustestTester,Molire,"> [Kukla](https://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/3175) also saw evidence that earth was now moving rapidly toward another ice age. Shortly after coming to Lamont, he organized a conference with Brown University geologist Robert Matthews on this idea. They summarized their findings in a 1972 paper in the journal Science, “When Will the Present Interglacial End?”  They also wrote to President Richard Nixon of the potential for floods, snowstorms and deadly frosts, as well as “substantially lowered” food production; they warned that the Soviet Union was probably already considering a response.

> The White House reacted quickly. By 1973, the State Department formed a Panel on the Present Interglacial, and Congress held a series of hearings on the state of climate research and U.S. preparedness. A series of bills to create a national climate program were introduced; in 1979, President Carter signed the National Climate Program Act into law.

> The global cooling story captured the public imagination, propelling Kukla into cover stories in Time and Newsweek, a BBC special, “The Weather Machine,” and other popular media. Average temperatures had in fact been dipping in previous decades, possibly due to a short-term natural cycle and the effects of industrial smog.  

> Global warming would soon replace fears about global cooling, but Kukla stuck to his contention that an ice age was due soon, at least in geological terms.

And northern hemisphere is not the globe. It;'s a statement of the truth, and you know it.  

Now, if you want to make your argument, you have to:

a) Demonstrate a strong SCIENTIFIC consensus from the 1970s that the GLOBE is cooling and was predicted to continue doing so. Not a few newspaper articles about a part of the globe.

b) Demonstrate that there has been no advance in climate science since then, because the changing of conclusions with better evidence and models is part of science - but the crux of your argument is that scientists are basically making it up to suit themselves so conclusions from the 1970s are as valid as those from the 2020s.

mulletator,iamnotarobot542,"Take a look at the following review of two peer-reviewed papers, Mitchell et al. (2020) and McKitrick and Christy (2020):

[https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biad080/7319571?login=false](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biad080/7319571?login=false)

The review states that climate models overstate atmospheric warming, and this issue has worsened over time. Both studies focus on the latest generation of climate models (CMIP6) and compare their outputs to post-1979 observations. They found that these models consistently predict higher warming than observed, particularly in the troposphere, both in the tropics and globally.

The review argues that this persistent warming bias in models, not balanced by an equal measure of cooling, suggests a systematic error rather than random uncertainty, leading to the conclusion that future warming projections might be overstated.

This is not the only source showing a lack of backcasting ability in climate models.  The issue is inherent and is the reason why IPCC uses an ensemble of models to overcome their inaccuracies.",The Sixth Mass Extinction,"

mulletator,iamnotarobot542,"While the study finds that climate models have been generally skillful in projecting global warming trends, it also highlights the inherent uncertainties and complexities in climate modeling. These models are essential tools in understanding and predicting climate change, but their predictions should be considered with an understanding of their limitations and the evolving nature of climate science.

Here are a couple of points from that study:

* One potential area of inaccuracy in climate models, as pointed out in the study, relates to their ability to backcast or reconstruct past climate conditions accurately. The study acknowledges that no single model can backcast with complete certainty, highlighting the limitations and complexities of modeling the Earth’s climate system.
* The study uses an ensemble of models to offset the limitations of individual models. This approach implies that each model might have its own set of inaccuracies or uncertainties, which need to be averaged out for a more reliable prediction. 
* Some models projected more warming than observed, while others projected less. This variation suggests that while models may generally capture the trend of warming, their precision in quantifying this warming can vary. 
* The study mentions that the skill of early models in projecting future warming is impressive, considering the limited observational evidence at the time. However, this could also suggest that early models might have been calibrated or validated using a smaller set of data, which might not fully represent the complexity of the Earth's climate system.",The Sixth Mass Extinction,"

Consuming products is not the problem, that is part of living in modern society and will always happen. How are you going to tell people not to buy clothes and food and goods? thats just freaking stupid.

The problem is the goods we consume are toxic to us and the methods of production are harmful to the environment.

The consumers do not control this factor. Governments do. They set standards for a marketplace and control allowable behavior.

Ever heard of swill milk? The only reason we are not drinking milk cut with cow brains, blood, and fermaldahyde is due to gov standards. Its not like people suddenly decided to not die from poisoning anymore.

juntareich,iamnotarobot542,"“Is the Great Barrier Reef reviving - or dying? Here's what's happening beyond the headlines

This year, the rapid coral rebound paused. Some reefs continued to recover, but these were offset by others which lost coral. Coral loss came from effects of the 2022 bleaching event in northern and central regions, crown-of-thorns starfish predation in the northern and southern regions, damage from Tropical Cyclone Tiffany in the north and coral disease in some areas of the south.
The picture is complex. Recovery here, fresh losses there.
While the recovery we reported last year was welcome news, there are challenges ahead. The spectre of global annual coral bleaching will soon become a reality.
Coral bleaching on on the central Great Barrier Reef during the summer of 2022. Image: AIMS
Right now, marine heatwaves are sweeping through ocean basins in the northern hemisphere. Sea surface temperatures are far above long term averages.
At least eight countries are reporting coral bleaching, including the United States and Belize. This summer, it looks likely we’ll see our first El Niño on the Great Barrier Reef since 2016, bringing higher sea surface temperatures. That last El Niño – coupled with global heating – was the direct cause of the 2016–17 mass bleaching and mass death of corals.”

On the one hand, we’re saying “we know we added lots of fucking CO2 to the atmosphere and things seemed to change negatively, so we’re gonna try to reduce that as much as possible and see if that helps”.

On the other hand, what if all these changes are a result of a completely different and not human-related system for which the CO2 change is merely a drop in the bucket?

We really don’t know for certain which one is right. However, I think it’s a noble goal to leave the planet better than how we found it. To me, that means reducing imbalances we can be certain we caused.

The scientific method is designed to be objective, but in reality, research can be influenced by a variety of factors including political beliefs, funding sources, and public expectations. Studies that claim drastic or catastrophic outcomes tend to receive more media attention, which can create a feedback loop that encourages more extreme claims. This is not to say that all or even most climate research is biased, but it's crucial to approach each study with a critical eye.

The current rate of species extinction is not solely or directly caused by human activities. It's important to consider the natural dynamics of Earth's history, where extinctions have occurred regularly and are a part of the evolutionary process. The Earth has experienced five major extinction events long before human intervention, driven by natural geological and astronomical factors.
  

  
Additionally, the fossil record, which serves as our primary source of information on past extinctions, is incomplete and subject to interpretation. This makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the exact causes of current extinctions. The complexity of ecosystems and the multitude of factors affecting them, including climate variability, geological changes, and biological interactions, suggest that extinction is a multifaceted process not exclusively attributable to human actions.
  

  
While human activities like habitat destruction, pollution, and overexploitation of resources undeniably have impacts on biodiversity, it is an oversimplification to attribute all current extinctions to these factors alone.

PlacerGold,iamnotarobot542,"Our understanding of past extinction events is derived from the fossil record, which, while extensive, is inherently incomplete. The fossilization process is selective and rare, meaning that not all organisms leave behind fossils, and those that do are not always discovered. Consequently, our estimates of extinction rates from millions of years ago are based on a fragmentary record. This limitation introduces a significant degree of uncertainty into our calculations of past extinction rates.
  

  
Additionally, the temporal resolution of the fossil record is another factor to consider. Geological strata can provide a broad picture of life across different eras, but they lack the precision to capture the nuances of extinction events that might have unfolded over thousands or even millions of years. This lack of granularity means that while we can identify mass extinction events and their general characteristics, determining the exact rates and timelines with high accuracy is challenging.
  

  
In contrast, our current observations and data collection methods allow for much more granular and precise monitoring of species and ecosystems. With modern technology, we can track individual species populations, their distribution, and the specific threats they face in real-time. This high-resolution data provides a more accurate picture of the current rate of extinctions and biodiversity loss.

mulletator,iamnotarobot542,"The human contribution to current sea level rise is often overstated, and the reliability of climate models is questionable. 

Firstly, the rates of sea level rise have varied significantly throughout Earth's history due to natural processes. For instance, during the end of the last Ice Age, sea levels rose rapidly due to natural melting of ice sheets, a rate that far exceeds current sea level rise. The current increase, estimated at about 3.3 mm/year, is modest in comparison to these past natural rates.
  

  
Moreover, attributing the majority of the current sea level rise to human activities oversimplifies the complex interplay of natural factors. Processes like thermal expansion, tectonic activities, and natural climate variability significantly contribute to sea level changes. The human-induced component, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions, is just one part of this broader picture.
  

  
Regarding climate models, a major limitation is their ability to be accurately back-tested against long-term historical data. These models are often calibrated using recent climate data and make assumptions about cloud formation, ocean currents, and other complex processes. The inherent uncertainty in modeling these variables, coupled with the limited historical data for validation, leads to questions about their accuracy and reliability, especially for long-term predictions.

While human activities contribute to climate change and sea level rise, their role should be viewed in the context of the Earth's dynamic and naturally varying climate system. The limitations of current climate models further complicate the task of accurately predicting future changes, underlining the need for a more cautious and nuanced approach to interpreting these predictions.

There is a growing concern about climate alarmism, which often deviates from actual scientific data. Alarmism tends to amplify the human contribution to climate change and sea level rise while downplaying or ignoring the significant natural variability of Earth's climate system. This approach can lead to an unbalanced representation of the risks and impacts, potentially skewing public perception and policy decisions.
  

  
The portrayal of climate change in some media and advocacy circles often focuses on worst-case scenarios, extrapolating from data in ways that the underlying science does not necessarily support. This can create a sense of urgency and crisis that goes beyond what is warranted by the empirical evidence.

mulletator,iamnotarobot542,"Man's contribution is extremely small.  I'll give you an example.  The current rise in sea level, occurring at a rate of approximately 30 cm per hundred years, can be understood within the broader context of Earth's glacial and interglacial cycles, particularly in relation to the last ice age. This ongoing process is a part of the gradual exit phase from the last ice age, which reached its peak around 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch.
  

  
The Pleistocene, part of the Quaternary period, was characterized by repeated glacial cycles where vast ice sheets covered large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. During these glacial maximums, sea levels were significantly lower due to the large volumes of water trapped in ice. The last glacial maximum saw sea levels as much as 120 meters lower than present levels.
  

  
Since reaching the peak of the last ice age, Earth has been transitioning into an interglacial period known as the Holocene, which began approximately 11,700 years ago. This period is marked by a gradual warming trend, leading to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, a process that contributes to the current rise in sea levels. This melting releases significant volumes of water back into the ocean, causing sea levels to rise.
  

  
The rate of sea level rise has not been uniform over these thousands of years. It was much more rapid in the early stages of the Holocene, during events such as the Meltwater pulse 1A, when rates of sea level rise were several meters per century. However, in recent millennia, the rate has slowed to the current rate of approximately 30 cm per hundred years.
  

  
That rate has accelerated slightly since the Industrial Revolution due to CO2 emissions.  The projected rate of acceleration is about 3% per century.  That means that if continue burning fossil fuels and change absolutely nothing the global sea level will rise 31cm in the next 100 years instead of 30cm.
  

  
Regarding the idea that we are currently experiencing a mass extinction.  As of the most recent assessments, it's estimated that about 0.1% to 1% of all species have become extinct due to human activities since the year 1500. This estimate is based on documented extinctions and assessments of known species, primarily from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and other scientific studies.
  

  
In contrast to the ""Sixth Mass Exctinction"" the K-T extinction, which occurred about 66 million years ago, is estimated to have wiped out approximately 75% of all species, including the non-avian dinosaurs. This catastrophic loss of biodiversity was primarily due to a massive asteroid impact and subsequent environmental changes.

Uhm… no. The acceleration from the near stagnant sea levels of the previous couple thousand years can’t be tied to the end of the last glaciation. The sea level rise associated with that began to slow down thousands of years ago. The sea level rise we’re seeing now is due to us.

>The Pleistocene, part of the Quaternary period, was characterized by repeated glacial cycles….. The last glacial maximum saw sea levels as much as 120 meters lower than present levels.

>Since reaching the peak of the last ice age, Earth has been transitioning into an interglacial period known as the Holocene, which began approximately 11,700 years ago.

The Holocene peaked about 10 to 8 thousand years ago. The current warming is unrelated.

It slowed to well below 30cm per 100. The last century was the highest rate in millennia. And with recent acceleration the next 100 will be well above 30cm. Three times that rate is projected.

>That rate has accelerated slightly since the Industrial Revolution due to CO2 emissions.  The projected rate of acceleration is about 3% per century.

You’re problem seems to be that you look back at final numbers that occurred over very long periods of time.

With us having turned so much of nature’s systems to our purposes it seems likely.

Regarding the K-T extinction, it's true that many mass extinctions in Earth's history were not caused by meteor impacts but were due to rapid climate changes, occurring without any human influence. The Holocene Thermal Maximum and the concept of Milankovitch forcing are well-known to me as a geologist. However, these examples highlight that our grasp on Earth's long-term climatic cycles is still developing.
  

  
Our current climate models, frankly, leave much to be desired.

Furthermore, our grasp of the interaction between various long-term climatic cycles remains limited. Although we have identified and named several of these cycles, such as Milankovitch cycles, this does not equate to a complete understanding of how these cycles interact with each other and influence the Earth's climate.

mulletator,iamnotarobot542,"In observing the discourse surrounding climate change, it's notable how some advocates of mainstream climate theories exhibit a fervor reminiscent of religious zealotry rather than a balanced, scientific approach. This is evident firstly in their unwavering faith in climate models, which are often treated as irrefutable despite their inherent limitations and the complexity of climate systems. Much like religious texts, these models are seen as absolute, overshadowing the reality that they are simplifications, reliant on assumptions that may not fully capture the nuances of Earth's climate. 

Additionally, there's a marked intolerance towards dissenting views or data that challenge the prevailing narrative. This echoes the way religious zealots might dismiss or shun non-believers, a stance that is antithetical to the foundational principles of scientific inquiry, which thrives on questioning and debate.Furthermore, the manner in which climate change is frequently portrayed – as an imminent, catastrophic event demanding immediate and drastic action – mirrors the apocalyptic scenarios often associated with religious dogma. This alarmist perspective can sometimes overshadow the need for a nuanced understanding of the data and a balanced, thoughtful response. The discourse often takes a moralistic tone, where those who question the mainstream view are not just seen as scientifically incorrect, but morally reprehensible, akin to sinners in a religious context. The complexity of climate issues is frequently reduced to overly simplistic terms, much like how religious texts might provide straightforward explanations for intricate phenomena.",The Sixth Mass Extinction,"

PlacerGold,iamnotarobot542,"The anti-human mindset expressed by some of the comments in this thread is deeply problematic.

""Humans are the least endangered species on the planet…….unfortunately""

""May be best if humans go extinct too.""

Where is that coming from?

It is a curious paradox when members of the human species advocate for the notion that humans are a blight upon the Earth, even going as far as to suggest that human extinction would be beneficial. This perspective fails to recognize the inherent contradiction in humans condemning their own existence while simultaneously benefiting from the advancements and comforts provided by human ingenuity and society.

Such extreme viewpoints also carry a moral and ethical dilemma. They imply a troubling willingness to overlook the value of human life and the potential for positive human contributions. Advocating for the diminishment or extinction of any species, including humans, is a dangerous path that leads away from constructive dialogue and problem-solving.

In essence, while it's critical to confront the environmental challenges posed by certain human activities, adopting an anti-human stance is counterproductive. It fails to harness the very qualities that make us human – our intelligence, empathy, and capacity for change – to create a more sustainable and harmonious relationship with our planet.

The anti-human rhetoric often found in climate discussions amounts to a form of virtue signaling and moral posturing, which is both disingenuous and counterproductive. When individuals make extreme statements about the detriment of human existence to the planet, or even wish for human extinction for the sake of environmental preservation, it often serves more as a display of commitment to an ideological narrative rather than a constructive contribution to the solution.",The Sixth Mass Extinction,"

chadisdangerous,legend0102,">From what I read in the IPCC, they think climate change will slowly unfold over a hundred years.

We are CURRENTLY seeing unprecedented natural disasters and weather anomalies all over the world.

Like, there are major insurance companies that don't currently allow policies in California and Florida. We're regularly seeing heatwaves in the high 30s-low 40s C range in Europe and China and all over the place. Canada's forests have been burning for a good part of this year.

So even if the state of affairs is that we're in for a HUNDRED YEARS of the current situation slowly getting worse, that's pretty god damn bad isn't it? 100 years is a long time and there's a lot of things that could collapse in that timeframe if tipping points are breached along the way.",I need to know if there is hope,"I know, frequently asked question.

No, it's doesn't. 

Here's two quotes from the 2023 synthesis report:

""With further warming, every region is projected to increasingly experience concurrent and multiple changes in climatic impact-drivers. Compound heatwaves and droughts are projected to become more frequent, including concurrent events across multiple locations (high confidence). Due to relative sea level rise, current 1-in-100 year extreme sea level events are projected to occur at least annually in more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 under all considered scenarios (high confidence). Other projected regional changes include intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms (medium confidence), and increases in aridity and fire weather (medium to high confidence).""

>Meaning the change no increase in extreme weather events, or we stay the same, is rated with High confidence.

Even if your first point were true, this is ... completely illogical? You must know that. 

>The IPCC calculates that climate change with knock 4% off of global GDP over the next 100 years, so instead of growing 400%, it will grow 396%.

If you truly wanted to make change towards a better society, you would strive for that excellence regardless of the **hypothetical** future. Because everything anyone tells you is completely hypothetical and speculation.

My advice is really sit down and think if that’s something you want to do. Because the last part of your post says to me it’s not really what you want to do, otherwise the unknowable future Earth won’t be an inhibiting factor, it would be the **driving** factor to get into it and prevent said “collapse”

I can’t comment on the future Earth. Technology is advancing so quickly we have no idea what a 10 year future looks like, and the cosmos is so unpredictable we have no idea what could happen, for better or worse.

This is what's known as a bad faith argument.

There is no one who is ""hoping"" for a future of doom. 

But for those who closely follow (or work in) the science of climate change, there are lots of reasons to be fearful.

That's not to say we should give up hope, or stop being optimistic. We have to have hope, and keep working.

Competitive_Mark8153,legend0102,"There is hope, but will only become manifest if the important people profiting from climate change are stopped. This means that people need to give up their illusions about authority figures and the rich. Really, most people enable the corrupt system to get a paycheck. We have many people working for Elon Musk and other scum and it's their labor that keeps these billionaires rich. 

The high regard that we place upon corrupt people is ensuring our demise. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, people were tired of corporate record labels, so they created their own labels. A similar thing has to happen now in the workplace. Corporations are the primary drivers of climate change. We should deprive them of money and our labor. 

It may require protesting and other direct action to fight the system, but this must be partaken in intelligently, because protestors are often negatively portrayed in the media, like how WTO protesters were maligned in 1999. It still needs to happen. Since social media has entered the scene and people think they can be activists online, only, protests have died down considerably. However, getting things to change requires physical engagement. 

We also need to question and call out the public relations campaigns that polluters engage in. Like when BP has a commercial showing their dedication to planting trees or whatever, they're doing this to hide the fact it's their oil that is causing climate change. We need to be savvy about not getting, ""greenwashed,"" and support only companies that deal only in clean energy.

Another part of the problem are weak people, who are in denial about the climate and so much more. Some people may get on board if they find clean energy alternatives benefit them in some way. To get these people involved naturally will require deconstructing the propagandists who manipulate their fears for their own agenda. I think about Donald Trump in this example. Basically, the problem with our society is how information is or isn't disseminated. 

Maybe you could get even Conservatives on board if you could get them educated. I find those people fear the educated and feel neglected by them. It's the blue collar element I'd place in that category. We need to not hoard education for ourselves and our kids, but make sure all people in our society get educated. 

Too often the white collar and middle class workers only use their money to feather their own nest and pay for their kids college education. They do this for kids they haven't even had yet. No consideration to democratizing education is given a second thought but we all live with the consequences of ignorance. This has to stop. We need everyone educated enough to make good decisions.

I did my 4 year tour in local government. Effing waste of time. 

Realistically there is only one year, since 2009 than global emissions dropped, that being 2020 with a global lockdown. And it was barely a dent, which we have easily surpassed in 2021, and once again in 2022. We have to somehow reduce overall emissions by 40% in 8 years, and yet never in our industrial history have we been able to drop it even by a percentage, and that required a global recession, or global pandemic. 

No one ever really looks at the numbers. People go on about dumb things like 'look at the huge percentage increase there was in solar'! Whoopie. That record setting increase STILL didn't meet the increase in energy consumption. Despite all that wonderful wind and solar installed, China was adding 2 coal plants per week in 2022. 

At the rate we are going, we won't even start decreasing emissions until 2040.

Dutch have been doing this for years with up to 1/3 of nation below sea level. We similarly have New Orleans.

Worried about 1.5C vs.  perhaps 2.5C avg. global temperature rise?

- 1850 to 1900 avg. was 56.5F
- Current is 59F, at 1.4C rise
- 2.0C rise would be 60.08F global average 
- 2.5C rise would be 60.98F which likely would take centuries if ever given slow progress

No need to accelerate spending. In the 1920s when the world had 2 billion folks, 500,000 died annually due to extreme weather. Today at 8 billion, it's closer to 11,000 annually.

If you live in the West, the U.S. & EU/UK produce around 20% of annual CO2. China & India combined make around 40% with their necessary coal power. Recent articles say aerosol pollution blocks sunlight so perhaps we shouldn't worry that they choose to pollute a while longer.

No need to make similar mistakes today insisting on immediate change in other places with different needs.

Then you should use all the expertise to cure cancer since it makes you an expert in everything including climate science. I have more college than that and I would never claim to know as much about climate science as the experts. 

>Antarctica ice is thick & it still has cold winters?

What does that have to do with more heat waves, more droughts, more heavy precipitation, and sea level rise.

>Netherlands has a large airport 11' below sea level along with 31% of the nation?

The Netherlands have the same problem as everyone else. They built their sea walls years ago when sea levels were not rising or rising at a slow pace. Now that pace has increased a lot and they are having to invest a lot of money to protect against that rise. They are a fairly wealthy country and can afford some rise but there is a limit to what they can do. It doesn't matter how low the country is below sea level, what matters is how high can they afford to built a sea wall or pump out the water. Two minutes of research will fill you in.

>China & India are building more coal plants, & that together (32% + 8%) they put out more CO2 than the U.S. (12+%) and EU/UK (8%)???

Yes but the US and the EU are responsible for a lot more of the CO2 that is already in the atmosphere. And the US produces twice as much CO2 per capita as China or India.  It's everyone's responsibility to lower emissions rapidly.  

>Plants like CO2 (?) & can get by with less water in its ample presence?

If they can get the water. Hard to do in a drought. That said, most people are more concerned about humans than plants. Especially when the government is paying farmers to NOT grow crops. 

>You are smarter than physics PhD Dr. Happer & dozens of others?

When many thousands of climate scientist are saying Happer and the dozens of others are wrong, it seems pretty obvious which way to go. Just like most people make decisions in other arears of their life. If 10 doctors say you need an operation and 1 doctor says don't worry, most would have the operation.

>Guess I need to ask my valedictorian, now ER doctor daughter, about the certainty of science 80 to 200 years into the future. 

Well the global temperature projections due to global warming they got right 30-40 years ago. What makes you think they will get it wrong in the future. Science has given mankind the best living conditions ever known.

>They (& you chemists/virologists) got it so perfectly regarding COVID-19. Somehow, 5 vaxx jabs didn't keep me from getting Omicron.

The vaccine saved tens of thousands of lives if not more. What did they get wrong. No one every said someone wouldn't get COVID. The said it would reduce the mortality rate drastically and the symptoms would very probably be much less. And that's what happened. 

>and yet now should fear a few extra degrees more than nuclear war?

Not fear, do something about since we can. The last glaciation was only 5C to 6C lower than pre-industrial temperatures which caused drastic changes in the climate and sea levels even though it was a very slow change over thousands of years. And you think a 2C or more increase will be minor. Right.",I need to know if there is hope,"I know, frequently asked question. But let me explain.

>What does that (Antarctica ice) have to do with more heat waves, more droughts, more heavy precipitation, and sea level rise.

Droughts in some places, flooding in others. That's how it has always been. It's not existential. Even 40 million population California has thrived for decades in drought, yet still insists on tearing down dams. Stupidity.

Don't make your overpopulation problems an issue for other areas that make smarter decisions. Flyover country shouldn't have to pay for coastal urban area problems their own liberal or NIMBY policies refuse to address.

Yet their farmers still protest stupid national decisions. Nothing they could do will change China/India coal policies. All they can do is build higher seawalls in the hundreds of years sea level will rise mere meters. Singapore plans similar for their reclaimed land. Miami turned down seawall opportunities.

>Yes but the US and the EU are responsible for a lot more of the CO2 that is already in the atmosphere. And the US produces twice as much CO2 per capita as China or India.  It's everyone's responsibility to lower emissions rapidly.  

Completely irrelevant to the future problem. Small reductions in the U.S./EU 20% can't put a dent in the China/India 40% that will continue growing another decade(s).

>If they can get the water. Hard to do in a drought. That said, most people are more concerned about humans than plants. Especially when the government is paying farmers to NOT grow crops. 

1.6 of 1.9 billion U.S. acres are used for crops, grazing & forests. Only 3% worldwide & in U.S. is urban. There's ample room to expand into smaller cities. We don't need more huge urban heat islands distorting temperature readings & needlessly scaring folks.

We also don't need to cut down trees or rob crop/grazing land building square mile plus solar farms powering just 25k homes. That requires 70+ square miles of solar to replicate the new nuclear power of two new Georgia reactors capable of powering 1.75 million homes.

The 97% are guilty of hubris in believing they accurately can predict 80 to 200 year outcomes based on limited, often modeled data that poorly replicates clouds that only will increase in hotter conditions, blocking out the sun.

The vast majority of doctors said to get vaccinated & I agree they were correct. They weren't correct about everything to include side effects, youth vaxxes, cloth masks, school closings & business shutdowns, or the ""pandemic of the unvaccinated.""

>We'll the global temperature projections due to global warming they got right 30-40 years ago. What makes you think they will get it wrong in the future. Science has given mankind the best living conditions ever known.

No, our car manufacturers, home builders, engineers, electricity producers, & farmers have given the world the best way of life. We should trust their solutions more than the reductionist naysayers who give up easily or attempt to force their decisions onto others (like COVID-19).

93% of the U.S. pandemic deaths were 50+. Half our non-coastal U.S. population & no doubt more than half the world will not be existentially affected by climate change. Why did Texas just pass a $10 billion ballot measure to subsidize non-renewables if they alone would suffice?

>The vaccine saved tens of thousands of lives if not more. What did they get wrong.

Answered earlier above.

>Do something about it since we can. 

Which is why we'll get there eventually. But trying to accelerate ""it"" (EVs/renewables/fossil fuel elimination) only hurts federal, state, local, & family budgets. We have other more critical near term priorities like deterrence, debt/deficit & inflation reduction, local jobs & manufacturing, housing expansion, drugs/border safety, homelessness, saving Social Security, etc.


>The last glaciation was only 5C to 6C lower than pre-industrial temperatures which caused drastic changes in the climate and sea levels even though it was a very slow change over thousands of years.

False choice. We're already at 59F & the sky isn't falling. 1850 to 1900 temperature is irrelevant. Scientists need to explain/prove why the current 59F average globally is nowhere near devastating yet 60.98 (1.1C higher) suddenly becomes world-ending. 

> And you think a 2C or more increase will be minor. Right.

We're talking 2 degrees FAHRENHEIT increase over current average global temperature (59F) over decades. We're already at 1.4C. It might rise 1.1C before 2100, with sea levels only meters higher by then, if that much.

Sure. Who's going to pay for that all over the world. Are the rich countries going to pay for river and ocean flooding for 1,000 of miles of walls for the poor countries.

>Droughts in some places, flooding in others. That's how it has always been. It's not existential. Even 40 million population California has thrived for decades in drought, yet still insists on tearing down dams. Stupidity.

Non existential for humans but it well might be for civilization. It's always been that way but not this bad with droughts that are getting worse, wildfires that are getting worse and running out of water. California is not the only place on the planet where that is happening.

>Don't make your overpopulation problems an issue for other areas that make smarter decisions. Flyover country shouldn't have to pay for coastal urban area problems their own liberal or NIMBY policies refuse to address.

More extreme weather along with sea level rise is affecting almost every area of the planet.

All they can do is build higher seawalls in the hundreds of years sea level will rise mere meters. Singapore plans similar for their reclaimed land. Miami turned down seawall opportunities.

But it's all over the world. Those people will be moving and will lose there most valuable possessions. And who is going to pay for it.

>Completely irrelevant to the future problem. Small reductions in the U.S./EU 20% can't put a dent in the China/India 40% that will continue growing another decade(s).

Not irrelevant to the developing countries. Small reductions are not going to cut it. And China could cut it's emissions a lot if it just stop selling products to the US. Do you have any idea what that would do to both countries. And why is the US producing twice as much CO2 per capita as China. 

>1.6 of 1.9 billion U.S. acres are used for crops, grazing & forests. Only 3% worldwide & in U.S. is urban. There's ample room to expand into smaller cities. We don't need more huge urban heat islands distorting temperature readings & needlessly scaring folks.

Urban heat is not distorting temperature results. Temperatures from urban heat islands are adjusted to account for that, urban areas are a very small part of the total land and sea area, and results using only rural areas are the same as when using the total areas. That's just a denier lie. 

>The vast majority of doctors said to get vaccinated & I agree they were correct. They weren't correct about everything to include side effects, youth vaxxes, cloth masks, school closings & business shutdowns, or the ""pandemic of the unvaccinated.""

That was a policy decision, not the results of any scientific report. 

>No, our car manufacturers, home builders, engineers, electricity producers, & farmers have given the world the best way of life. We should trust their solutions more than the reductionist naysayers who give up easily or attempt to force their decisions onto others (like COVID-19).

Engineers use scientific principles for everything they do. All of the things you listed are the result of  a whole lot of engineers working with scientific advances over the last two centuries. 

> We should trust their solutions more than the reductionist naysayers who give up easily or attempt to force their decisions onto others (like COVID-19).

The scientists developed the vaccine. The politicians made the decisions you are talking about.

>93% of the U.S. pandemic deaths were 50+. 

What does that have to do with climate change.

>Half our non-coastal U.S. population & no doubt more than half the world will not be existentially affected by climate change. 

If civilization fails because of extreme weather, sea level rise, and migration every person on the planet will be affected. 

>Why did Texas just pass a $10 billion ballot measure to subsidize non-renewables if they alone would suffice?

No idea and what does that have to do with climate change.

>Which is why we'll get there eventually. But trying to accelerate ""it"" (EVs/renewables/fossil fuel elimination) only hurts federal, state, local, & family budgets. We have other more critical near term priorities like deterrence, debt/deficit & inflation reduction, local jobs & manufacturing, housing expansion, drugs/border safety, homelessness, saving Social Security, etc.

Nothing is more critical that preventing the destruction of civilization.

Global temperatures have fluctuated about +-0.5C since civilization began. We are now about 0.5C above that fluctuation. If we get to 2C above that it will be 4 times what we are seeing right now. 

I don't know why you keep on repeating that lie about world-ending since no one is saying that. But it might end civilization.

>We're talking 2 degrees FAHRENHEIT increase over current average global temperature (59F) over decades. We're already at 1.4C. It might rise 1.1C before 2100, with sea levels only meters higher by then, if that much.

No we are talking at least 1.1C over current global temperatures and maybe much more. 40% of the population live on the coasts. A 1 or 2 meter sea level rise will be devastating to those communities. Many coastal areas have a 1:10 slope from the water. That means for every 1 meter of sea level rise, 30 feet of land will be under water. And that's an average sea level rise which doesn't account for high tides and storm surges.

There has been no time in the history of the homo genius that we lived in temperatures as warm as we are seeing and will see. Those ""desert Indian tribes"" you speak of have never lived in the extreme heat we are beginning to see. Not only has the entirety of human evolution taken place during an ice age period, but there were far fewer people, and they were nomadic. In other words, for over 95% of human history, we were able to move with the changing climate. Now, we are seeing extreme changes in climate all over the globe and have a population too big to allow us to migrate to more hospitable locations. On top of that the fact that the ***average global temperature*** is rapidly increasing, which means habitable areas of the globe are rapidly decreasing.

Reichukey,legend0102,"I don't think there is any guarantee of anything. Things change all the time. You never know if an asteroid will hit the planet, or if a car will hit you or if you will choke on food. 

Personally, I don't see any evidence that humans will collectively stop all emissions and somehow transition to entirely ""renewable"" energy. We don't have the materials to do so. If we don't stop emissions then the planet will continue to warm. We are currently seeing an alarming rise in temperatures possibly due to increased regulations on aerosols. The world's oceans are heating up too, and may be nearing their capacity to collect the heat from our use of fossil fuels. The delicate chemical processes that allow for food plants to live are all of of whack because of artificial fertilizer, not to mention top soil being used very very quickly compared to how long it takes to form. The extinction of other species that live on the planet, animal and plant, are increasing. They are connected to our food web. So are pollinators. And so, if all these and many more ancient processes come to an inflection point at a similar time, and all these exacerbate each other during that, the world as we know it will have changed into something completely different than before. I have a hard time believing humans will survive that change. 

We are a species who has gone into overshoot. A global species, with the ability to change the global systems in ways we do not intend, or don't care much about. 

But, you can decide that despite all this, you will do what you can to change the trajectory. That is what hope is, and it still exists. Why not make it your mission, if you feel called? Perhaps that will be the start of another global systems change. One that lives in the hearts and minds of people like you who care deeply about what is happening. Surely, like any other possiblity, this one is worth pursuing. I would say, the idea of giving up because you can't instantly change something is stupid. Climate change can't be reversed or stopped or even slowed in one day. It will take gumption and patience.

bshell99,legend0102,"Most of the pronouncements regarding climate change are highly speculative. I am NOT a climate change denier and I strongly believe we need to cut way back on the amount of burning of fossil fuels. Personally I've put solar panels on our house and we drive an electric car. 

However, I often wonder: given that we are just making guesses about the future, why not make optimistic guesses? In Nature and in Physics increasing the heat of a system GENERALLY leads to good things. Warm toast is better than cold toast. Hot tropical jungles have far more diversity of life than the barren freezing poles of the planet. Etc. 

I wrote an opinion on Climate Change on my [science.ca](https://science.ca) website here: [my personal view on global warming](http://www.science.ca/askascientist/viewquestion.php?qID=3990). 

A key part of that essay is the idea of having optimism for the future, while at the same time WE MUST STOP THE BURNING!! From the link above:

I don't understand why all the Global Warming hype is only about doom and disaster. Flooding, storms, famine, etc. As long as you are just guessing and making things up out of thin air why not make up positive and optimistic speculations. Here are some examples that seem quite reasonable. The warmth will cause a flowering of new species. This is what happened in the past, so we have good reason to expect it will happen again. Rising sea levels could cause an increase in fish and seafood, created by whole new areas of ocean bottom and new intertidal zones that can be colonized by existing and maybe even new species of fish and other sea life. These areas will be near the shore and near human populations. More food for humankind. More storms mean more rain, more flooding and an overall increase in fertile land over time so more crops for more people. My point is: as long as you are speculating--you really have few observable facts--you are just making things up, why not make up nice positive optimistic things about global warming. Both the bad and the good have an equal chance of occurring. In fact, it's a certainty that both bad and good things will happen as a result of global warming. Most modern species on Earth including the primate precursors of humans appeared during the Eocene about 50 million years ago when the Earth was so warm there was no ice on the poles. In the past, life on Earth has flourished during warm periods.

BUT: I repeat, the bottom line is WE NEED TO GREATLY REDUCE THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS. The current rate of burning and the rate of increase of burning is totally insane.",I need to know if there is hope,"I know, frequently asked question. But let me explain.

This exact mentality has led to all the issues we are currently facing. So the only question you need to figure out is if you want there to be any hope for a future or not. If you want a future that is better than this one, then you need to change your mindset and start focusing on how you can make a difference in your own way. If your willingness to work for change depends on what others are doing, then you might as well just give up now.

EdFelsonx923,legend0102,"Not sure if I (m52) am a doomer or not.  
I know in mid 80s there was doom and gloom.  None of those predictions came to fruition.  Supposedly in the 70s and late 60s there was doom and gloom.  None of those predictions came to fruition. 

I am skeptical that the doom and gloom that is being predicted now is accurate. 

Having said that, I don’t believe we should ignore CC.  But I don’t believe we have to sacrifice everything to try and save the planet. 

Whatever happens to the planet with respect to CC, we humans will adapt.  
For me, if the choice is drastic changes (massive changes on how we do things to force a green society) that will ultimately starve people to death (not enough food or prices too high or loss of jobs kind of thing) or slowly incorporate greener ways of doing things that may result in climate catastrophes that kill millions (as we are not making the changes fast enough) I prefer the latter. 

Also whatever happens… we cannot stop the climate from changing.  We cannot stop the next ice age.  We may change when it happens, but we cannot stop it.  
And at the end of the day… that big ball of fire is going to go out one day.  By that time human existence will have disappeared for millions of years.

National-Blueberry51,legend0102,"It depends on what you mean. Will things reverse and return to normal? Not for a long time and not without major changes. Can we reduce the harm and even improve our quality of life in the process? Absolutely. Obviously there are major barriers to this, but everyone else has detailed them, so I’ll give you my perspective as someone who works on water and energy stuff. 

Right now there are literally millions of people working to build a future worth living in. We’re talking massive carbon capture, a regenerative farming revolution, lab grown proteins, re-wilding land, precision ag, expanded electric grids with mixed renewables, etc. So much stuff. I get amped just thinking about some of the projects I’ve seen. These changes are happening at the local, regional, and societal levels. They’re just slower than anyone would like and slower than we need. 

There are two things that help me when the existential dread hits hard.

First, remember that even harm reduction or buying time is still worthwhile. Working together really does make a difference, and just a few passionate people can make change with the right help. There’s a big difference between an uninhabitable planet and a changed one. 

Second, there’s this concept called equanimity and not attaching oneself to outcomes. No one, not even the rabid doomers, can say for sure what will happen in the future. Good things and bad things will happen, and they will be beyond your control. If you find yourself mourning what you’ve lost or bracing for a future tragedy, give yourself permission to let go.

Perfect-Resort2778,legend0102,"If you truly want to advance to the next level you have to put aside your own bias and filter what you learn from other people based in their bias.  There is this primal characteristic of all humans to look at bad things while ignoring the good.   In ancient times it was critical to our survival as it allowed our predecessors to be fearful and escape real life dangers.  Today it is mostly an annoyance.  

One thing you have to consider is that climate catastrophe has been predicted for decades if not centuries on end.  The gloom and doomers have been wrong time after time.  That should give you some hope.   

Confirmation bias is the sole reason for their inaccurate predictions.  They just cherry picked the data and their base of knowledge to confirm their preconceived narrative.  It's not just climate change.  People do this on just about everything.   Good news doesn't sell newspapers and generally speaking you can manipulate people based on their fears.  

If you plan to successfully operate in the political arena you are gonna have to become a master of the human condition.

PlacerGold,legend0102,"Your question touches on a vital aspect of any public policy and political effort: understanding the nature and scale of the challenges we face. When it comes to climate change, there's a lot of information out there, much of it alarming. However, as a geologist and someone who views these issues through the lens of Earth's long-term natural processes, I offer a perspective that might provide a different kind of hope.
  

  
Firstly, it's important to recognize that Earth's climate has always been in flux. The geological record shows periods of warming and cooling over millions of years. These changes are often slow and driven by a complex interplay of factors like solar radiation, volcanic activity, and even the movement of continents.
  

  
In the context of human-induced climate change, it's true that activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation have increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, the extent to which these activities will impact the climate, and the rate at which these impacts will occur, is a matter of ongoing scientific investigation and debate. Some of the more catastrophic predictions you may hear in the media or from certain scientific circles are based on models that may not fully account for the complexity and resilience of Earth's systems.
  

  
As for the idea of a ""climate emergency,"" this is a term that carries a lot of weight and urgency. While it's undeniable that we're seeing changes in our climate, the geological perspective suggests that these changes are part of a longer, more gradual process. This doesn't mean we should be complacent, but rather that we have time to adapt and innovate.
  

  
In terms of policy and your role in politics, I would argue that there is indeed hope and a future worth working for. The key lies in balanced and informed decision-making. This involves recognizing the need for sustainable practices, investing in green technologies, and being open to a range of viewpoints and solutions. Remember, environmental stewardship is just one aspect of a healthy society, and it's important to address it in a way that also considers economic stability, social well-being, and cultural values.
  

  
In summary, the geological perspective suggests that while climate change is real, it may not be as immediate and catastrophic as some predict. There's room for optimism and a future to work towards. Your efforts in politics can be part of a thoughtful approach to navigating these challenges, ensuring a balanced and sustainable path forward for society.",I need to know if there is hope,"I know, frequently asked question.

ENERGY OPTIMISM

Solar and wind are growing so fast they’re doubling about every 5 years. Indeed, in 2025 so many solar factories will open they'll have FOUR TIMES the capacity of all the solar built in 2022 - nearly a terawatt per year. That works out to be all today’s electricity in 17 years from 2025. And that’s just solar - and does not include new wind, hydro power, nuclear, geothermal, etc.  https://xenetwork.org/ets/episodes/episode-184-eroi-of-re/
  

  
Of course electricity demand is going to SKYROCKET as we “Electrify Everything”. We’re going to need a lot more electricity for transport, mining, industrial heating, smelting, and even synthetic petrochemical streams from hydrogen and CO2 in seawater. But here’s more good news. Overall ENERGY demand will shrink. Why? Because burning stuff for energy is really inefficient. EG: Gasoline cars waste 80% of the oil as heat and noise, but EV’s waste only 20% and turn 80% of the original solar energy into forward motion. As we Electrify Everything, we’ll only need 40% of the original thermal value of the fossil fuels. (Burning stuff is THAT inefficient!)  https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/electrification-energy-efficiency 
  

  
That means as renewables double every 5 years to the final goal, as we Electrify Everything the final goal ALSO starts to move back towards us!
  

  
Clean tech and EV’s are all growing SO FAST that the head of the International Energy Agency predicts that oil demand will peak by 2026 and decline from there.  https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028
  

  
We have good reasons to believe we’ll be done by 2050.
  
http://theconversation.com/theres-a-huge-surge-in-solar-production-under-way-and-australia-could-show-the-world-how-to-use-it-190241
  
People are going to be shocked at how fast things change across the next 10 years, let alone 20.
  

  
By 2030 America will have up to 15 TIMES the EV battery capacity - meaning almost 100% of cars could be EV. (This is just a comparison for illustration purposes. It’s NOT an assertion that America will stop importing cars and build 100% EV's themselves. These batteries will of course be split between EV, household, business, and grid utility sectors.)
  
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/05/map-which-states-will-build-the-most-ev-batteries-in-2030.html

If the problem is the net carbon emissions, then there is more than one way to skin a cat here and we should pursue all that society will actually accept. Are for example, if the problem is cars producing carbon emissions, then you can solve that by either stopping using cars entirely, or switching to a different type of car that doesn't produce carbon emissions, ie EVs. Now getting rid of cars might sound good to you personally, but good luck getting the rest of society to do that. Switching to EVs is not only much more likely to be adopted society wide, but will work much better in the current system.

My point is, there is more than one way to do things and the best more realistic way is to combine many solutions in a realistic way. Reduce emissions, plant trees, and capture carbon. We need all of them, and arguing against any one is counter productive.

All while they pilfer tax dollars and make consumers feel good that they can keep consuming at untenable levels. There is no magical level of efficiency that will come with time that ever allows this to scale into anything meaningful. This concept is always going to be the equivalent of trying to soak up an ocean with a damp cotton ball. Not even discussing that you still need to somehow store it, which really can't be done in any permanent manner without spending even more energy to seal it underground. Anything less just ends up right back into the atmosphere. This is money that should be going to real solutions we know are needed. 

We've spent over a century pumping massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. We now continue pumping over 50 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every single year just by existing. Let's say this vaporware was magically scaled up to the point where all of the easiest CO2 to capture at industrial manufacturing (which is the literal only thing this is realistically designed to deal with) was captured every year. Then we somehow store it in a way that doesn't just inevitably re-release back into the atmosphere in a little bit of time.

While that is true, keep in mind that the cost of battery cells are now under 1.2 cent per kWh stored, LFP battery cells are at $95 per kWh, and good for 10,000 full cycles to 80% capacity.  And with EV sales now at 14% price signals can be used to incentivize charging during times of excess wind and solar production.  And of course any energy intensive (non-continuous) manufacturing can take advantage of low prices, keeping wind and solar running, and cheap :)

1. It can be used as a battery. You can store H2 and burn it later. And some are getting around the leaking problem by storing the H2 in ammonia, easily liquified, stored and shipped, and already has a market in fertilizer.

2. Tests are already being performed to mix H2 into existing fuel at nat gas power plants. The nice thing here is H2 pumps through the existing nat gas pipeline infrastructure very well. So, you might be able to use H2 to bypass the permitting headaches of new electricity transmission lines. Instead of building hundreds of transmission lines from the solar fields/wind farms to city centers, we might be able to pump the H2 through pipelines and use the energy. 

None of this is terribly cost effective yet, and the tiny size of H2 as a molecule means leaking could be a big headache, but it’s all in R&D phase now.","The first US commercial plant has started to pull carbon from the air.

H2 is much cheaper to transport than electricity through wires are, and so even if thermodynamically inefficient, it is $ efficient, and pipelines further double as storage.

u/reddolfo answered this in another thread and I saved it. The scale of what’s needed is immense and the problem is that we are out of time now. 

“You clearly haven't studied the science. The only functioning CCS (carbon capture & storage) ""tech"" out there today is the Climeworks carbon capture plants, initially developed in Iceland. The Orca prototype sequester's 4,000 tons of carbon per year.

1 gigaton of emissions would require 250,000 plants, each sequestering 4,000 tons per year. If a new plant is brought online every 8 hours, four new plants every day, it will take 171 YEARS to build enough of them just to sequester ONE gigaton of carbon emissions.

But today we are globally emitting almost 60 GIGATONS of emissions every single year alone, not even counting the 1.2 trillion tons of cumulative emissions that have been building up in the atmosphere. The idea that this tech, the most advanced tech out there (while most others are merely theoretical ideas or investigational prototypes), can do anything at all in the time remaining before cascade events and tipping points is sheer lunacy.”

Conservation of energy. You will always invest more energy to pull CO2 back, than energy released.

Solution: don't burn the match, use that power instead for heating.

flossypants,Ornery-Honeydewer,"There are various ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. If humanity prioritizes climate drawdown, multiple approaches will be pursued, which optimize cost per ton of CO2 and other cost/benefits (e.g. land use, agronomic productivity changes, etc.).

This particular approach has factory capital expenses, operating expenses, and power usage (which, if renewable  has its own capital and operating expenses). The sum of these (assuming an amortization schedule for the capital costs) is the cost per ton of CO2 for this process. For many processes, analysts can estimate cost reductions as the process is refined and scaled up.

How does this process compare to alternatives? I suspect poorly, since I don't see the above analysis cited to the study. I research biochar climate drawdown and the cost per ton of CO2 is far lower than that of direct air capture (DAC), especially if one recognizes biochar's indirect carbon impacts such as co-composting emission abatement and non-pyrogenic soil organic carbon development. There are also piloted studies reporting that biomass' volatile mass can be captured and stabilized (e.g. in bio-asphalt).","The first US commercial plant has started to pull carbon from the air.

mulletator,Splenda,"Contrary to popular belief linking forest fires in Alberta to oil production by major companies lacks substantial evidence. Forest fires, historically and ecologically, are a natural phenomenon, particularly in regions like Alberta with its specific climate and terrain. These fires have been occurring for centuries, driven primarily by natural factors such as lightning strikes and prolonged periods of dry weather. The suggestion that recent increases in forest fire incidents are a direct consequence of oil production activities oversimplifies a complex interplay of environmental factors.  
Moreover, the contribution of the oil industry to global greenhouse gas emissions, while significant in the broader context of climate change, cannot be specifically and directly correlated to the frequency or intensity of forest fires in a localized region like Alberta. Climate change itself is a global phenomenon, influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the scope of any single industry. The specific impact of oil production on local climate conditions that could exacerbate forest fires remains scientifically inconclusive.  
Additionally, forest management practices, which include how forests are maintained, managed, and harvested, play a crucial role in the prevalence and severity of forest fires. The accumulation of underbrush due to suppression of smaller fires, for instance, can lead to larger and more intense fires later. Thus, it's critical to consider these practices when examining the causes of increased forest fires.  
In conclusion, the assertion that oil production activities by major companies in Alberta are directly responsible for an increase in forest fires is not substantiated by clear evidence. It's important to consider the broader and more complex set of factors, including natural climate variability and forest management strategies, when analyzing the causes of forest fires in the region.",What Canada's most expensive disaster ever teaches us about climate change,,2023-11-14 05:22:20

AndyTheSane,CO2nvert,"Well, it depends on how we measure sensitivity:

\- The immediate, CO2-only effect of doubling CO2 might be quite small, perhaps 1.2K. This is what you'd see if you flicked a switch to double CO2 and waited perhaps 6 months to a year.

\- Then you have fast feedbacks, like increasing the water content of the atmosphere as it warms up. That could increase sensitivity to perhaps 2.7K.

\- Then you start looking at other feedbacks like sea ice retreat and biosphere changes which could take it up to 3K - but take decades to play out.

\- Then you get into even longer feedbacks. Whole ocean circulation takes c. 1000 years, so heat that you 'bury' by ocean circulation can take centuries to come out. Ice sheets on land can take 1000s of years to fully respond to warming, and then the climate has to adjust to higher sea levels. This kind of effect can lead to a total sensitivity over 4K.

""Modelled dietary scenarios often fail to reflect true dietary practice and do not account for variation in the environmental burden of food due to sourcing and production methods. Here we link dietary data from a sample of 55,504 vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters with food-level data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication risk and potential biodiversity loss from a review of 570 life-cycle assessments covering more than 38,000 farms in 119 countries. Our results include the variation in food production and sourcing that is observed in the review of life-cycle assessments. All environmental indicators showed a positive association with amounts of animal-based food consumed. Dietary impacts of vegans were 25.1% (95% uncertainty interval, 15.1–37.0%) of high meat-eaters (≥100 g total meat consumed per day) for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1% (7.1–44.5%) for land use, 46.4% (21.0–81.0%) for water use, 27.0% (19.4–40.4%) for eutrophication and 34.3% (12.0–65.3%) for biodiversity. At least 30% differences were found between low and high meat-eaters for most indicators. Despite substantial variation due to where and how food is produced, the relationship between environmental impact and animal-based food consumption is clear and should prompt the reduction of the latter.""","Diets consisting exclusively of plants were 25.1% of high animal products for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1% for land use, 46.4% for water use, 27.0% for eutrophication and 34.3% for biodiversity (n = 55,504)",,2023-11-11 17:09:33

Apptubrutae,News-Flunky,"It’s a bit of a tricky problem. Very rarely can any one event be definitively tied to climate change.  As any climate scientist can confirm.  There are some exceptions, of course, but not most.

It’s all probabilities and such.  And even the most definitive things, like how hot this summer was, aren’t easy and compelling to report on: “hot again today!”

Meanwhile the big disasters really may well of happened either way.  Not like Katrina was the first hurricane to decimate New Orleans.  Not like the flooding in California recently is unprecedented historically.

It by and large all could have happened with or without climate change.  But the rate, severity, and probabilities are all where the story really lies.

Aaaand that is just crappy reporting.  Nobody wants to hear it unless they’re directly interested.  Everyone wants correlation to equal causation and things to be because of a single, definitive cause.  The issue is less the reporting and more what people are capable of understanding.  Good reporting on climate change simply loses listeners/viewers from the general public because the issue is too complicated.

toasters_are_great,No_Smile821," 1. You have an energy cost for harvesting and turning wood into pulp that you only have to pay very little of if you're recycling cardboard and paper.
 2. Energy cost of digging a big hole that's deep enough and sealed enough for long enough to sequester the carbon.
 3. If you bury it you have to be damn sure that it doesn't get digested anaerobically such that the methane farts can get to the surface because that'll be **far** worse than burning it.
 4. It's not just atmospheric carbon plus water that builds wood, there are trace minerals and other micronutrients from the soil.  If you bury the wood->cardboard/paper then you bury the micronutrients too, which will either need replacing in the soil or the soil will become less able to grow the next generation of trees.

Overall_Arugula_2695,Splenda,"OK we'll stay on your positioning electric vehicles (EVs) as a viable alternative to oil for personal transportation.

While electric vehicles have their merits, they also have substantial limitations that challenge their viability as a wholesale replacement for fossil fuels.  
Firstly, let's address the range issues. Even with advancements in battery technology, electric vehicles still face 'range anxiety' due to their limited range compared to traditional ICE vehicles. Long-distance travel requires careful planning to ensure availability of charging stations, which can be sparse, especially in remote areas. This limitation hampers the feasibility of EVs as a complete substitute for fossil fuel-powered vehicles.  
Secondly, there's the concern of reliability and lifespan, particularly pertaining to batteries. The performance of EV batteries degrades over time, significantly impacting the vehicle's range and effectiveness. Replacing an EV's battery is not only expensive but also raises environmental concerns regarding the disposal of the used battery and the mining and processing required for the materials to produce new ones.  
Thirdly, while EVs don't burn oil, they're not entirely free from oil either. Many components in EVs, from lubricants to the plastics in the body and interior, are petroleum products. The production of these components still depends on fossil fuels, which means EVs don't completely sever the ties with oil.  
Now, consider the energy sources. If we were to switch to electric vehicles en masse, the current energy grid, which still heavily relies on fossil fuels, would face enormous demand. This shift could result in increased burning of coal and natural gas to meet electricity demands, which may offset the benefits gained from moving away from oil in vehicles.  
As for the infrastructure, the build-out required for a comprehensive network of charging stations would be massive and costly. We're talking about an overhaul of the entire energy distribution system to accommodate EV charging needs, which includes upgrades to our electrical grid to ensure it can handle the load without failure or excessive energy loss.  
Lastly, the economic and social implications cannot be overlooked. The transition to EVs would necessitate a restructuring of the job market, with significant impacts on industries related to oil extraction, refining, and distribution. The transition could lead to job losses if not managed with a clear and fair strategy for retraining and employment support.  
In sum, while EVs are a step in the right direction and offer benefits in reducing tailpipe emissions, they are not a silver bullet. They carry their own set of challenges that must be addressed before they can be considered a fully viable alternative to oil. The transition to electric vehicles requires careful consideration of these limitations and a gradual, well-supported shift with robust policy backing and technological innovation.",Governments plan to produce double the fossil fuels in 2030 than the 1.5°C warming limit allows,,2023-11-14 19:32:25

Overall_Arugula_2695,Splenda,"It's commendable that you've had a positive experience with your sub-150-mile range EV for 8 years, which shows that EVs can indeed work well for many people. However, we must recognize that personal experience doesn't equate to universal applicability. While newer BEVs do offer extended ranges that can exceed 320 miles, this is not the standard for all models, especially more affordable ones. Range capability also diminishes over time as battery capacity degrades.  


  
On the point of charging stations not being sparse in most of the U.S., the distribution of charging stations is highly uneven and tends to be concentrated in urban areas and along certain highway corridors. Once you move into rural or less economically developed areas, the availability of charging stations drops significantly. This uneven distribution can hinder long-distance travel and poses a serious inconvenience for those living outside of densely populated regions.  


  
As for the comparison with Europe and China, their infrastructure for EVs, particularly charging stations, may indeed be more developed, in part due to government policies that aggressively support EV adoption. However, the United States has a much larger geographical area with a substantial rural population, making the task of achieving a comparable level of infrastructure more challenging. The scale of the U.S. and the distribution of its population mean that national coverage requires a significantly higher number of charging stations.  


  
Moreover, the time required to charge an EV, even with fast chargers, is significantly longer than the time needed to refuel an ICE vehicle. This can pose a challenge for people who need to use their vehicle continuously without long breaks, like for some business uses or emergency services.  


  
While EVs have made great strides and will undoubtedly play a critical role in reducing reliance on fossil fuels, there remain significant hurdles to overcome before they can fully replace fossil fuels across all aspects of personal transportation. These include improving the affordability and accessibility of high-range EVs, ensuring the reliability and longevity of EV batteries, expanding and upgrading charging infrastructure, and transitioning the energy grid to cleaner sources.

Overall_Arugula_2695,Splenda,"The debate over the viability of electric vehicles (EVs) compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles encompasses not just technological capabilities, but also practicality, lifestyle adaptation, and broader economic implications. Advancements in EV technology have resulted in models offering over 320 miles of range, but this figure does not fully address the practical challenges many users face. Weather conditions, driving styles, and frequent usage of car accessories can significantly reduce this range. Furthermore, the starting price of around $46k for these models is much higher than the average cost of a new gasoline or diesel vehicle, making EVs a less accessible option for a large portion of the population, particularly when considering the total cost of ownership.

  
Charging practices add another layer to this issue. While it's true that 90% of charging is done at home or at work, this overlooks the limitations for individuals without access to private parking or those living in multi-unit dwellings. The dependency on a network of high-speed chargers for long-distance travel is also problematic. The distribution of charging stations is not yet as widespread or conveniently located as traditional gas stations, especially in rural or less developed areas. This presents significant barriers for long trips, off-road adventures, or in regions with nascent EV infrastructure.

  
The durability of current generation LFP batteries, while impressive, may not align with the financial or lifestyle realities of many consumers. The high upfront cost of EVs and the rapid pace of technological advancements can deter buyers concerned about their vehicle becoming outdated. Moreover, the current rate of EV sales, although growing, is still a small fraction of the global vehicle market. The transition to EVs requires not only consumer willingness but also substantial changes in infrastructure, energy production, and societal habits.

  
When considering those living outside urban areas, particularly workers in natural resource industries, EVs' practicality is even more limited. These professions often require vehicles capable of navigating rugged, off-road conditions, which many current EV models cannot adequately meet. The durability and reliability of ICE vehicles in various terrains and under harsh conditions remain unmatched by most EVs. Moreover, the lack of charging infrastructure in remote areas, coupled with potential range reduction under heavy loads or in extreme weather conditions, poses significant challenges.

  
In urban areas, EVs are a practical and environmentally friendly option, but the high initial cost remains a barrier. However, in rural settings and for off-road applications, particularly in natural resource industries, ICE vehicles continue to be the more practical choice due to their versatility and reliability.

  
In summary, while EVs offer environmental benefits and technological advancements, their current state makes them more suitable for a niche market rather than a comprehensive solution for all transportation needs. The widespread adoption of EVs faces significant hurdles in terms of accessibility, affordability, and practicality, particularly in comparison to the efficiency and reliability of ICE vehicles.",Governments plan to produce double the fossil fuels in 2030 than the 1.5°C warming limit allows,,2023-11-14 20:53:39

Petroleum is an indispensable resource in our modern world, crucial for much more than just fueling our vehicles. It's a fundamental component in a wide array of products and industries, from the manufacturing of plastics and pharmaceuticals to its use in lubricants and various chemicals. The versatility and energy density of oil make it uniquely valuable, something that current renewable energy sources cannot fully replace. Renewables like wind and solar, while beneficial for electricity generation, face limitations in terms of energy storage, intermittency, and the inability to provide the raw materials necessary for numerous industrial processes. 

Moreover, the current infrastructure and technology for renewables are not yet at a stage where they can meet the global energy demands at the scale and reliability provided by oil.

Overall_Arugula_2695,Splenda,"Currently, we have no viable alternative to fossil fuels that can match their efficiency, scalability, and economic feasibility.  
Fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas, are incredibly energy-dense and efficient sources of energy. They are capable of providing a high amount of energy output per unit, which is a fundamental requirement for modern industrial processes and transportation systems. The alternatives, such as solar, wind, or even nuclear power, face challenges in terms of energy density, intermittency, and storage.  
Moreover, the infrastructure for fossil fuel extraction, processing, and distribution is deeply embedded in the global economy. The transition to alternative energy sources requires not just the development of new technologies but also a massive overhaul of existing infrastructure, which is a monumental task both financially and logistically.  
Additionally, beyond energy production, fossil fuels are integral to the production of various essential products. The petrochemical industry relies heavily on fossil fuels for manufacturing a wide range of products, from plastics to pharmaceuticals. While there are ongoing efforts to develop bio-based alternatives, these are still in nascent stages and not yet capable of replacing fossil fuels at the scale and efficiency required.  
In the context of agriculture, synthetic fertilizers, which are derived from fossil fuels, play a critical role in maintaining high crop yields to feed the growing global population. Alternative methods, such as organic farming, while environmentally sustainable, currently do not match the efficiency and scalability of conventional methods reliant on synthetic fertilizers.  
Therefore, from this perspective, while the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels is a significant concern, the current global dependence on them for a wide array of applications underscores the challenge in finding comprehensive alternatives. This reliance is not just a matter of preference but a reflection of the current technological and economic realities.",Governments plan to produce double the fossil fuels in 2030 than the 1.5°C warming limit allows,,2023-11-14 17:12:22

Nearly 50% of oil is used for fuel in personal vehicles.  At 15 cents per kWh, the energy use of a BEV costs less than half that of using gasoline in an ICE vehicle at $3.50 per gallon, so in that case there is a compelling alternative.  typical BEVs travel 125 miles on 33kWh, typical ICE vehicles travel 25 miles on 33kWh.

Overall_Arugula_2695,Splenda,"You say we don't need oil because electric cars can replace all fossil fuels for transportation. While the sentiment is aspirational, the argument is riddled with oversimplifications and a pinch of wishful thinking. Let's get real for a moment.

First, electric cars are indeed a significant step towards reducing our reliance on oil for transportation, but to claim they can replace all fossil fuels for transportation today is to ignore several gaping issues. The infrastructure for electric vehicles, including charging stations, is not yet ubiquitous, especially in rural and underserved areas. The grid itself, which would need to support this massive shift to electric vehicles, is currently neither robust enough nor sufficiently green to handle the load—unless you imagine that the electricity they run on is magically produced by fairies and not by a mix of coal, natural gas, nuclear, and yes, a growing but not yet sufficient portion of renewables.

Let's talk numbers. That 50% of oil used for personal vehicles sounds like a target ripe for the taking, but you're forgetting about the rest of the transportation sector—trucks, ships, airplanes, and the military. These are not segments where electric vehicles can easily step in with current technology. Heavy-duty transport requires power and range that electric technology can't yet deliver at scale, and electric planes are largely still on the drawing boards.

The economics, you say? At 15 cents per kWh, the energy cost of a BEV might be lower now, but electricity prices can fluctuate just like oil prices, and they're subject to the same market forces, not to mention the initial higher cost of electric vehicles. And while BEVs may travel further on the equivalent energy, that's assuming optimal conditions—battery performance dips in extreme temperatures and with age.

And then there's the environmental impact of producing these electric vehicles. Mining for lithium, cobalt, and nickel for batteries is not exactly a fairy tale of environmental stewardship. It comes with its own set of problems, including ecological damage and human rights concerns.

To claim that electric cars can fully replace oil is to look at the world through green-tinted glasses. It's a goal to work towards, but it's not the panacea you're painting it to be. It's a complex problem that requires a suite of solutions, including but not limited to the electrification of personal transport, advancements in battery technology, alternative fuels for various transport sectors, and a serious overhaul of our energy infrastructure.

So, while we should indeed push for more electric vehicles on the road, let's not kid ourselves into thinking that they're the silver bullet to end our oil dependency.

My understanding is that proponents of the idea cite things like methane on other planets, oddly deep oil that seemingly wouldn't have had biotic sources, wells which don't deplete as expected, the ability to create it in lab settings with the absence of biotic material, etc. It seems plausible that some amount may be abiotic but it seems like those working under the assumption it is biotic is far more predictive/lucrative (although that would allow the possibility that the geology of abiotic sources is still poorly understood).",Governments plan to produce double the fossil fuels in 2030 than the 1.5°C warming limit allows,,2023-11-11 21:29:19

Here you go.

Almost 100 wildfires are burning in B.C. as of Tuesday afternoon and officials are warning about human-caused, preventable fires.
  


  
Most of the fires were caused by lightning, but 17 were caused by people and the cause of seven remain unknown, according to the BC Wildfire Service.

and

“To date this year on Vancouver Island, BC Wildfire Service has responded to 46 fires, compared to two on the same day last year, so all 46 of these fires are known to be human-caused,” Sam Bellion with the BC Wildfire Service told Global News.","People from less affected areas like Europe (except for southern E.), New Zealand, Canada etc., how worried are you about climate change?","The western world will not suffer as much as the developing countries.

OrDarkByMorning,Glari7,"Ok, so for everyone who is seeing ""Human Caused"" reported for fire ignition, you should realize that it does not translate to arson. There are (unfortunately) MANY fires started each year that are human caused, though most are not with intent.  

- Unattended campfires (they can smoulder and fire back up well after people have left)
- Burning debris/grasses (they occasionally get away from people)
- Equipment use (yes, it's entirely possible for equipent use such as bunchers and tire chained equipment to spark off a rock and start a fire - I've been there first hand to put several out). Even truck or ATV use in long grass can start a fire. 
- Equipment/vehicle malfunction. Things occasionally catch on fire. In a wooded situation, that can be bad. 
- Careless smoking (apparently does happen)
- Yes even gender reveal parties or careless firework usage
- Any number of other random events that isn't natural. 
- Etc etc etc.

I've even been at one fire where the sun beating on someone's black grow bags out in a dry peat swamp was enough to heat up and start a wildfire in extremely hot & dry conditions that summer.","People from less affected areas like Europe (except for southern E.), New Zealand, Canada etc., how worried are you about climate change?","The western world will not suffer as much as the developing countries.

trtn48,Glari7,"Also Canadian here (30 years old living on the east coast), gonna piggy back on this.

I'm optimistic on a 25+ year timeline, but yeah the next few decades are going to be a challenge.

Here's how I see it.  Some major direct effects are already here like the wildfires and hurricanes.  This is the new norm, it will get worse before it gets better, and there will be signicant costs as we learn to live with it.

In addition to these we'll also be feeling the secondary effects of things like migration and supply chain shocks induced by the effects of climate change elsewhere.  I hope to be proven wrong, but it's hard to imagine housing and food costs dropping much in the short term.

I remain optimistic for the long term because we really are moving towards solutions at a breathtaking pace, even if it doesn't seem like it.  I'll give one example, as a first time homeowner last year, having bought a house with oil heat, it cost $4200 for heating last winter.  

Installing heat pumps, I expect our year round cost for both heating and cooling to be a worst case of $2000.  So our costs are cut in half, we get a more comfortable house year round, and it's better for the environment.  That's fucking huge. 

I mention heat pumps because they are the best example of where green / sustainable tech has already won out over the old way of doing things.  Heating and cooling is only a small part of our overall emissions picture, but we really are on the verge of similar transformations in electricity generation, transportation, agriculture, and industry (i.e., literally everywhere that it matters).

One last note.  Here's an example of how far ahead I think we'll be in just a couple decades.  When I was a kid I would call my friends house on the landline after school.  If his parents were using the internet the call wouldn't go through.  That seems almost barbaric today, but it was like...22 years ago.  Give us a couple decades and we'll be looking at combustion engines, oil furnaces, and fossil fuel power plants the same way.","People from less affected areas like Europe (except for southern E.), New Zealand, Canada etc., how worried are you about climate change?","The western world will not suffer as much as the developing countries.

Canada is a northern country that shares a border with the USA and the USA alone. There's that one island we jokingly beef about with Denmark, but otherwise all our neighbors are separated from us by a fucking pole.

How, exactly, are climate refugees arriving? Seriously. Thousands of migrants die every year trying to cross the Mediterranean. The USA is a political and terrestrial barrier for those coming over land. There are very few places where people can slip in--as recently exemplified in Quebec. 

The real issue is that Canada is already suffering the effects of climate change that are exacerbated by our own activities. Forest fire is a season now. Entire watersheds are suffering drought. Other watersheds are seeing inundations that exceed disaster scenario modeling.

Northern Europe is seeing an upward trend in Summer holidays and that trend will only increase as these relentlessly hot Summer’s go on.

Culturally that changes the continent, and it will also have a huge economic impact.

By the 10th of November, my part of the country is usually buried under a decent cover of snow, yet instead today was a lovely crisp autumn day - a little rain in the am and sunny in the afternoon.  You might think, oh that sounds lovely!  But we are dependent on snowpack to manage drought levels and forests in the summers.  Lower risk of floods but thats countered by our farms being hit hard, and our largely monoculture forests potentially drying out.

Higher costs for everything as international supply chains buckle and break when the areas that produce various goods undergo ecological or political collapses (and a a country that imports a lot of essentials like good that's not just a matter of buying luxury electronics and fast fashion clothing on Amazon but a potentially very serious problem).   Our own politics becoming more extreme as the world order deteriorates - resentment towards the e tree levels of immigration our current government is pushing stands a good chance of bringing a very right wing conservative government to power as it is, and I have to imagine that will only get worse as the flow of people ceases to be a discretionary matter and completely overwelms our capacity to provide even basic support for.  Even the possibility of facing serious military threats for the first time in our modern history (having a quarter oft he world's fresh water sounds like a good thing in an ecological crisis right up until one of the military superpowers you border decides that they'd very much like you to sign it away to them and you remember that the last time you I vested in your own national defence was like the 50s).

Brief-Objective-3360,Glari7,"I'll admit, I am no expert. But my understanding is that AMOC collapse isn't just a temperature change for Western Europe, rather it is a fundamental change to their entire climate. I understand the reason you think it might be close to balancing out, but it doesn't really work like that. One of the ways AMOC helps europe is by keeping their climate stable. Yeah there still is some variability in their current climate, as there always will be variability no matter where you are. But for the most part, having the constant presence of the Gulf Stream/AMOC helps set the standard for what western Europe's climate should look like. So removing AMOC can be expected to increase their variability in climate, which can swing in many directions (hot af, cold af, dry af, wet af, etc). Like I said I'm not actually fully understanding what would happen after removing such a system, but I'm pretty sure the increased variability that can be expected will be noticeable.","People from less affected areas like Europe (except for southern E.), New Zealand, Canada etc., how worried are you about climate change?","The western world will not suffer as much as the developing countries.

DirewaysParnuStCroix,Glari7,"That's more or less it. It's infuriating how widespread the complete misunderstanding of the AMOC is, this is largely due to how the media sensationalizes the research and the limitations in what the researchers can conclude given their limited data samples.

People often misunderstand the current as the primary source of Europe's mild climate, but that's always been a contentious take. I believe some of the more recent observations state that it only contributes something like <10% to the temperature gradient.

But aside from that, according to the theory, the warming characteristic is more pronounced during the winter period. During the summer period, it does actually act as a cooling mechanism (particularly in the climates of northwestern Europe that are thoroughly wet). 

If the AMOC collapses, the theoretical outcome is much colder winters and much hotter summers. Aside from the catastrophic widening of the annual average temperature bracket, there's also the catastrophic drop in precipitation to contend with. As a result, most of Europe is actually more at risk from expanding desertification as the mechanisms required for cooling are massively outpaced by warming trends.","People from less affected areas like Europe (except for southern E.), New Zealand, Canada etc., how worried are you about climate change?","The western world will not suffer as much as the developing countries.

DirewaysParnuStCroix,Glari7,"There's a few outcomes that have been theorized. Among them is that by the time the AMOC does collapse, it'll be far too late to have any significant impact on temperatures. The only realistic effect would be a slowdown of the warming trend, which might plateau for a decade or so before warming resumes at a faster pace. During that plateau period, the average temperature might reverse slightly due to the massive drop in recorded winter temperatures, even though the summers would still be getting hotter. This is likely because Europe would experience a climate comparable to continental Canada, so the winter averages might drop to around -30°c (currently around the 10°c mark) whereas summers will climb to around +40°c mark.

mr_beakman,Glari7,"As a Canadian I am very worried.  I've seen the effects firsthand. While my forest home has not yet been hit by fire it seems like every year some area near us gets burned.  Places we used to visit in the summer that are totally charred now.  My home is in heavy forest with a creek running through it.  This year we had a prolonged drought and the creek was down to a trickle, and a lot of our old growth trees died or were severely stressed.  Our well was very low but we were lucky, our neighbors well dried up completely.  It's only a matter of time before we start seeing the creek dry up every summer and our well along with it.  Once that happens we have no means to fight fires.  We know that fire crews won't bother trying to save our place since it's so remote, and we have our own firefighting equipment, but it will be useless if the creek is gone.  

And yet Canada will keep cutting down the trees to ship off as pellets for heating in other countries, while simultaneously causing the extinction of the animals that depend on that forest.  We'll keep fracking gas to ship to other countries, and we'll keep extracting fossil fuels and minerals, all for the benefit of large foreign corporations.  These governments (and those employed by these corporations) are only concerned with how to make more money, no concern over what the end result will be.  I have family that routinely mock anyone who thinks climate change is a problem.  It's all a big hoax to them.","People from less affected areas like Europe (except for southern E.), New Zealand, Canada etc., how worried are you about climate change?","The western world will not suffer as much as the developing countries.

Ambitious_Surround36,Glari7,"I live in Ottawa and NEVER do I remember inhaling CAMPFIRE SMOKE walking outside my home, and I'm in my 30s.

It's definitely a totally different vibe than when I was young with the massive forest fires every year. And it's kind of weird how people don't want to hear it's ""climate change"". 

I don't think people realize that the last ice age was around 5 degrees celsius cooler than what we are now. And so a 2 degree celsius difference made Canada **literally light on fire this year.**

I am thankful I moved out of Ottawa. I would like to move to BC but I wouldn't want to now cause of the fires.

I moved to the East Coast where it's much cooler, less fires. It's just the winters here are twice as warm as they were 50 years ago, so it's really bizarre seeing GREEN GRASS in January. Last year there were insects still crawling around in the winter and people golfing in January.

Winter is only like 2 months long, still cold, though.

The thing I am worried about most are TICKS. Since we rely on the cold to kill the ticks. Now the ticks are terrible every year.

When people argue for a larger role for nuclear… do they not trust that the experts did the math correctly?,"How to determine if batteries (plus wind and solar and grid energy transfer) are better for replacement of fossil fuel grid energy than nuclear, or if nuclear is better than batteries","About a month or so ago, I posted about the merits of solar and wind compared to nuclear.

While I asserted that wind and solar are generally better than nuclear, I conceded that nuclear is better than batteries (in conjunction with wind and solar) in terms of ""capacity"" and reliability.  Specifically, for example, solar with tracking (and batteries) is generally estimated to produce 5x the wattage of nuclear (see source below).

[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table\_8.2.pdf](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table_8.2.pdf)

I noted that Nickel Iron (NiFe) battery technology is superior to what is currently being used, which is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePh), or other forms of Lithium battery technology, in that it is a higher return on investment, lasts much longer, can be easily repaired, is recyclable, and does very very little damage to the environment (basically negligible in the frame of reference of general battery technology).  The noteworthy downsides of NiFe are that it requires water to be added every few months, but this can be easily automated, and that the initial cost is high, but this would be negated entirely upon mass production (since the design is far simpler), and when comparing to a nuclear grid system they are likely to be cheaper, but it depends on the situation.

Credible sources consistently state that nuclear energy is of roughly equal environmental damage to solar and wind using Lithium batteries.  If Nickel Iron batteries are utilized, wind and solar would therefore be cleaner than nuclear.  Rooftop solar is also under-utilized to an extreme and should be absolutely subsidized as rooftop solar has no footprint (takes no land to use).

In the discussion on that prior post, something was brought to my attention, which in hindsight and when trying to summarize it now in introducing the issue, seems simple, but I think the issue is more complex than it at first will appear.  Obviously, solar and wind aren't reliable.  Batteries need to be used to store energy for downtimes.  Now lets say we get no wind and lots of clouds for some variable number of consecutive days.

Thus we can write a formula to tell us at what point the cost of batteries to account for solar and wind downtime will equal the cost to build a nuclear plant.  We can look at historical anomalies of having no wind and lots of clouds for consecutive days.

""Grid transfer"" (something I don't know much about) can also be used.

Some questions come to mind.

Namely would it be practical to use nuclear to provide a baseload of minimum required electricity during known downtimes (specifically the night, but also accounting to some degree for batteries and wind)?  This would depend on the answer to whether it is of roughly same cost to build a ""small"" nuclear plant to supply a minimum baseload of electricity at night as it would be to build a larger nuclear facility to power the entire needs of the grid.

Again, fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible.  I see absolutely no excuse for not replacing FF for production of grid energy.

Edit:

Let me try to restate the issue again.

The issue is that some people have argued that because solar and wind are inherently unreliable, and nuclear is inherently reliable, and because we would need enough nuclear to power the grid during solar and wind downtime anyway, we might as well go all in on nuclear.  This is somewhat oversimplified, because it does not include batteries.  With batteries, you can go without solar or wind for as long as you have watt-hours in the batteries.

This post is intended to be about the issue in the above paragraph.

My question is what the difference in cost would be between building a nuclear facility that can produce the minimum needs during downtime of solar (i.e. at night) and wind, and the cost to build a nuclear facility that can power the grid during the times when there is the highest need.

We have to determine which of the two options is better:

1. Build a small nuclear plant to power the grid at night, and then use solar and wind and batteries to make up the difference.
2. Go all in on nuclear.

I tried to provide a general guide in the post on how to answer that, as it depends, obviously, on the weather of the place where the facilities are being constructed.  If you only have 10 cloudy days a year, then you only need enough batteries to compensate for that.  If you regularly get 100 consecutive cloudy days a year, then you can calculate how much batteries you would need and compare it to the cost of nuclear.

I noted that Nickel Iron (NiFe) battery technology is superior to what is currently being used, which is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePh), or other forms of Lithium battery technology, in that it is a higher return on investment, lasts much longer, can be easily repaired, is recyclable, and does very very little damage to the environment (basically negligible in the frame of reference of general battery technology).  The noteworthy downsides of NiFe are that it requires water to be added every few months, but this can be easily automated, and that the initial cost is high, but this would be negated entirely upon mass production (since the design is far simpler), and when comparing to a nuclear grid system they are likely to be cheaper, but it depends on the situation.

Credible sources consistently state that nuclear energy is of roughly equal environmental damage to solar and wind using Lithium batteries.

Obviously, solar and wind aren't reliable.  Batteries need to be used to store energy for downtimes.  Now lets say we get no wind and lots of clouds for some variable number of consecutive days.

Thus we can write a formula to tell us at what point the cost of batteries to account for solar and wind downtime will equal the cost to build a nuclear plant.  We can look at historical anomalies of having no wind and lots of clouds for consecutive days.

Namely would it be practical to use nuclear to provide a baseload of minimum required electricity during known downtimes (specifically the night, but also accounting to some degree for batteries and wind)?

We can discuss the topics on their merits in this subreddit, and review the sources, without having to be paid by the government and various corporate interests millions of dollars to be qualified to discuss the subject.

Obviously, solar and wind aren't reliable.  Batteries need to be used to store energy for downtimes.  Now lets say we get no wind and lots of clouds for some variable number of consecutive days.

Thus we can write a formula to tell us at what point the cost of batteries to account for solar and wind downtime will equal the cost to build a nuclear plant.  We can look at historical anomalies of having no wind and lots of clouds for consecutive days.

""Grid transfer"" (something I don't know much about) can also be used.

Some questions come to mind.

Namely would it be practical to use nuclear to provide a baseload of minimum required electricity during known downtimes (specifically the night, but also accounting to some degree for batteries and wind)?  This would depend on the answer to whether it is of roughly same cost to build a ""small"" nuclear plant to supply a minimum baseload of electricity at night as it would be to build a larger nuclear facility to power the entire needs of the grid.

Again, solar with tracking and batteries produce 5x the wattage per dollar invested compared to nuclear.  Fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible - we are all in agreement on that.  It is prudent to be cognizant of how resources are spent, to the degree that is practical.

I believe it should not be difficult to compare the cost of nuclear to the cost of batteries needed for downtimes, and make the best decision.

Again, fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible.  I see absolutely no excuse for not replacing FF for production of grid energy.

Edit:

Let me try to restate the issue again.

The issue is that some people have argued that because solar and wind are inherently unreliable, and nuclear is inherently reliable, and because we would need enough nuclear to power the grid during solar and wind downtime anyway, we might as well go all in on nuclear.  This is somewhat oversimplified, because it does not include batteries.  With batteries, you can go without solar or wind for as long as you have watt-hours in the batteries.

This post is intended to be about the issue in the above paragraph.

My question is what the difference in cost would be between building a nuclear facility that can produce the minimum needs during downtime of solar (i.e. at night) and wind, and the cost to build a nuclear facility that can power the grid during the times when there is the highest need.

We have to determine which of the two options is better:

1. Build a small nuclear plant to power the grid at night, and then use solar and wind and batteries to make up the difference.
2. Go all in on nuclear.

I tried to provide a general guide in the post on how to answer that, as it depends, obviously, on the weather of the place where the facilities are being constructed.  If you only have 10 cloudy days a year, then you only need enough batteries to compensate for that.  If you regularly get 100 consecutive cloudy days a year, then you can calculate how much batteries you would need and compare it to the cost of nuclear.

Further analysis  of this 41-page source (since there are matches for ""nuclear"" outside of the ""energy storage technologies evaluated"" section) seems to indicate that there is no discussion of the questions that I asked here.  It is not fair to expect me to spend several hours thoroughly reading through the documents to see if they support your claims or not, they appear to not support your claims.

cheetahwhisperer,Consistent_Piano_210,"The burden of proof is on you though as you’re making the claims here.

I’m no battery expert, so I’d like to know more about this. The problem with nickel iron is it’s pretty heavily rooted in African labor, which is not a good thing. I think the sources of it are also questionable, along with the costs. Looking around, Nickel Iron batteries are not the most efficient, nor are they very cheap.

There are a couple problems with wind and solar. One, they were never meant to fully subsidize the power grid. However, there are some areas that have bountiful power from these renewable sources, and they’re selling excess power to other areas. Generally, these sources of power are meant to partially subsidize the dirtier sources of power.

Second, these renewable power sources are more efficient for some areas versus others. For example, coastal and off-shore regions provide more consistent wind for turbine generated power versus in-land areas. Solar power is most efficient in many desert areas as there’s typically less cloud cover there compared to other areas. One could place these renewable power generators anywhere, but they do so knowing some days or even seasons may not return as much consistent power versus nuclear.

Finally, there is the question about climate change effects on renewable energy sources. For example, there is the possibility of more cloud cover in a warmer future climate for some regions. There’s also a possibility for a weaker temperature gradient during some months for some regions in a warmer future, which would impact wind power generation.

Nuclear power doesn’t suffer the drawbacks of renewable energy sources, and is generally safe. However, nuclear power is very expensive in cost and time to build and maintain. There’s also the question of how and where to store nuclear waste.

Maybe you can ask more concise questions along with better arguments for your position? Perhaps this is why no one here appears to understand what you’re saying?

This would depend on the answer to whether it is of roughly same cost to build a ""small"" nuclear plant to supply a minimum baseload of electricity at night as it would be to build a larger nuclear facility to power the entire needs of the grid.

Again, solar with tracking and batteries produce 5x the wattage per dollar invested compared to nuclear.  Fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible - we are all in agreement on that.  It is prudent to be cognizant of how resources are spent, to the degree that is practical.

I believe it should not be difficult to compare the cost of nuclear to the cost of batteries needed for downtimes, and make the best decision.

Again, fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible.  I see absolutely no excuse for not replacing FF for production of grid energy.

Edit:

Let me try to restate the issue again.

The issue is that some people have argued that because solar and wind are inherently unreliable, and nuclear is inherently reliable, and because we would need enough nuclear to power the grid during solar and wind downtime anyway, we might as well go all in on nuclear.  This is somewhat oversimplified, because it does not include batteries.  With batteries, you can go without solar or wind for as long as you have watt-hours in the batteries.

This post is intended to be about the issue in the above paragraph.

My question is what the difference in cost would be between building a nuclear facility that can produce the minimum needs during downtime of solar (i.e. at night) and wind, and the cost to build a nuclear facility that can power the grid during the times when there is the highest need.

We have to determine which of the two options is better:

1. Build a small nuclear plant to power the grid at night, and then use solar and wind and batteries to make up the difference.
2. Go all in on nuclear.

I tried to provide a general guide in the post on how to answer that, as it depends, obviously, on the weather of the place where the facilities are being constructed.  If you only have 10 cloudy days a year, then you only need enough batteries to compensate for that.  If you regularly get 100 consecutive cloudy days a year, then you can calculate how much batteries you would need and compare it to the cost of nuclear.  If you regularly get constant winds when it's cloudy, then you can factor that in as well.",2023-11-11 00:36:33

While I asserted that wind and solar are generally better than nuclear, I conceded that nuclear is better than batteries (in conjunction with wind and solar) in terms of ""capacity"" and reliability.

I noted that Nickel Iron (NiFe) battery technology is superior to what is currently being used, which is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePh), or other forms of Lithium battery technology, in that it is a higher return on investment, lasts much longer, can be easily repaired, is recyclable, and does very very little damage to the environment (basically negligible in the frame of reference of general battery technology).  The noteworthy downsides of NiFe are that it requires water to be added every few months, but this can be easily automated, and that the initial cost is high, but this would be negated entirely upon mass production (since the design is far simpler), and when comparing to a nuclear grid system they are likely to be cheaper, but it depends on the situation.

Credible sources consistently state that nuclear energy is of roughly equal environmental damage to solar and wind using Lithium batteries.  If Nickel Iron batteries are utilized, wind and solar would therefore be cleaner than nuclear.  Rooftop solar is also under-utilized to an extreme and should be absolutely subsidized as rooftop solar has no footprint (takes no land to use).

In the discussion on that prior post, something was brought to my attention, which in hindsight and when trying to summarize it now in introducing the issue, seems simple, but I think the issue is more complex than it at first will appear.  Obviously, solar and wind aren't reliable.  Batteries need to be used to store energy for downtimes.  Now lets say we get no wind and lots of clouds for some variable number of consecutive days.

Thus we can write a formula to tell us at what point the cost of batteries to account for solar and wind downtime will equal the cost to build a nuclear plant.  We can look at historical anomalies of having no wind and lots of clouds for consecutive days.

> ""Eighty per cent of the islands we've looked at have either remained about the same or, in fact, gotten larger,"" he said.

In contrast, 28 islands experienced area declines (totaling -7.24 ha). Consequently, in the words of Kench et al., overall there was ""a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9%), despite sea level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls.""

> In commenting on these observations, the authors say they ""challenge perceptions of island loss, showing islands are dynamic features that will persist as sites of habitation over the next century."" And that really is a nice way of acknowledging the ridiculousness of climate alarmist portrayals of Tuvalu -- its islands are not drowning from an inhospitable rise in sea levels and its inhabitants are in no danger of becoming climate refugees.

2. Relative sea level is projected to increase by 0.2-0.3 m by 2050 relative to 2005 and 0.5-1.0 m by 2100, with an upper-end worst-case estimate approaching 2 m. 

3. The majority of Tuvalu sits at low elevation, and much of the land plus critical infrastructure will sit below the level of the current high tide by 2050.

4.Future sea the level rise will cause a large increase in the frequency and severity of episodic flooding within the 21st century for Tuvalu. Across all future scenarios and under the assumption of no additional protections, Tuvalu will experience more than 100 days of flooding every year by the end of the century.

Consistency shows that the general predictions are true even if the models struggle to nail the exact numbers at specific dates due to many values that only exist in ranges or averages.

So no you're wrong, it's very scientific to predict trends and ranges of change, and as long as the prediction of those ranges is consistent (within a certain tiny margin of error) then the theory holds true, even if the numbers are way off on a specific predicted day, the average temperature change year over year is consistent.

DirewaysParnuStCroix,LackmustestTester,"I've consistently made this same point, to be fair. The methods used to reconstruct hypothetical scenarios are often dubious, but the results of such are quoted as gospel. For the most part, we're reconstructing hypothetical scenarios based on what we *think* happened in the past, and there's just no good comparison to previous AMOC collapse events as they all occurred under very different conditions that simply don't exist in the modern era. As such I've always been heavily skeptical of the modelling used to reconstruct hypothetical outcomes, particularly any that predict cooling.

One thing I take particular issue with is the trope of widespread cooling in the northern hemisphere in response to a partial or full collapse. I believe this is one of the outcomes modelled by the aforementioned modelling methods, but we can demonstrate that a partial or complete collapse of the AMOC actually results in much hotter and drier summers across Europe. Modelling software doesn't seem to account for knock on effects such as atmospheric blocking caused by the changes in currents and crucial details such as the almost total absence of glacial cover found in the modern era when compared to previous regional cooling events (all of which can actually be attributed to other factors such as volcanic activity and meteor strikes).",Can We Trust Projections of AMOC Weakening Based on Climate Models That Cannot Reproduce The Past?,,2023-11-09 23:30:59

RemoteGood2503,stisa79,Please explain how a satellite 8000 Kms away can read the ocean SST and at what time does this all corelate and how is the coverage. They make it up. The other option is to admit the billions spent on the mission failed. The ocean and most other objects emit radiation in the infrared and the microwave wavelengths. The amplitude of these wavelengths vary with the temperature of the ocean and therefore can be used to measure it. **Satellite sensors can measure these bands from space**. Stick a cloud in the way and see what happens. There are ocean currents moving masses of water. In 20 years NASA will admit it never worked but the ones they use now do.

aaronturing,stisa79,">Extreme event attribution is a field of science. We don't need to rely on anecdotal evidence at all.

It is a field of science. The same as all sorts of dodgy science. The question is how robust and accurate is this field of science. In my opinion with a very good reason it's very poor science.

Did you know that climate change modelling relies on maps that don't have the localized detail to predict climate change events at that level of detail (localized extreme weather events) ? Did you also know that they have that level of detail to predict the weather ?

RemoteGood2503,stisa79,"Can only white people read a thermometer? Do you need the temperature of every point on an object to get a good idea of the temperature?

The indigenous people here had loincloths and sticks. Just like Africa in 1850

So according to you it's a vast conspiracy of thousands of scientist all over the world from every country. That makes sense.

That gets rolled out a lot. The methods used to average a temperature do not have enough data points. Politics get involved with the results shared. I care not for politics however the UN WEF and WHO have made it clear these organisations wish Western countries to build funds in a bank of their choice and they will spend it how they choose to save the planet. The discussions have now rejected using the world bank as America will have too much control. The deal is pay up and let us deal with it. These COP meetings have degenerated to how Europe will split up Africa. 

Medical science does not explain the randomness of how satellites allegedly know the surface temperature of the entire planet at all times to be able to see a change. Satellites are good at taking pictures.

It is good that you provided that link though however it shows the flaws in the science.

""Because our planet is warmer, on average, the hot days are becoming hotter. And, because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, rain storms are growing more intense. Warmer oceans are also producing stronger hurricanes.""

This shows how poor the attribution science really is. Did you know how weather predictions work ? They have the ability to state well there is a 70% chance of rain next week or whenever based  on current measurements and historical data about how weather works.

At the moment all they can do is attribute weather event x to climate change and state is shouldn't have occurred this much. It has basically no predictive capability in relation to localized events.

clickster,stisa79,"\#1. You're right, the models don't have as much localized detail. But that's because climate models explore long-term behaviour of the entire climate system, not local weather phenomenon.

\#2. Large scale climate models CAN provide localised extreme weather event predictions because large-scale atmospheric patterns like heat waves, droughts and floods can be usefully predicted with these models.

\#3. Attribution studies don't just rely on models - they also use historical observations, simulations, and atmospheric physics.

As a result, attribution studies can reliably tell us how much more likely extreme events were by comparing how an event would have occurred without climate change, to what actually occurred.

Yes I have a problem with the way scientific studies are reported within the context of the examples posted above however I also think that lot's of people believe that climate change caused all of those events and that to me is something that is very hard to prove scientifically.

So I bet you and others will argue that the bush fires in Australia were caused via climate change however there are so many other factors that contributed to this issue that could also be stated as causing the bush fires. Was it really climate change ? Was it El Nino ? Was it a lack of back burning ? Was it a combination of all these factors ?

Australia also has had mild summers for a number of years ? Do we now state well climate change is clearly false since we haven't had bush fires ? Has climate change gone away ? If not then why haven't we had those bush fires ?",Can we please stop the anecdotal evidence?,"This is posted on both r/climatechange and r/climateskeptics, because I see it in abundance on both subs.

-explore-earth-,stisa79,"The thing about science is that if we have a study showing that fires in Australia for example are increasing and it’s correlating nicely with climate, such as:

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27225-4

Well, it’s totally open for another group to come in and say, actually, we looked at the data. Fuel accumulation explains most of the increase. Or El Niño. Or whatever. 

This happens all the time and is how scientific understanding is built. We get studies showing “this data says x”. Then some will publish “well yes, but you have to consider that this data …”. 

I saw an example of this just today for example. 

Big study recently claimed that the Amazon is showing early warning signs of collapse due to findings from an innovative method of remote sensing. Another study is now published as of yesterday saying, actually, that may be an artifact of the data you used. We tried it another way and weren’t able to replicate that. 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01853-8

This is how science works. So, perhaps you disagree with my first linked paper shows that correlation with climate and Australian wildfire. Any scientist who looks at the same phenomenon and finds that something different is causing the trend we observed is actually incentivized to publish about it.

You aren't actually stating anything that I disagree with. My point is to do with the reality that there appears to be more credence given to climate change as a cause of extreme weather events without in my opinion sufficient proof.

For example, you say: consider the flip side, if an extreme weather event doesn’t occur, or is reversed, does that mean climate change doesn’t exist? 

In the context of criticizing event attribution studies. 

But those studies don’t use the occurrence of weather extremes as a justification for the reality of climate change. They don’t make those type of claims.

Sometimes media outlets sort of do, but again… that’s just how media is. 

All the actual studies do is state: in X climate, Y type of event can be expected to happen Z% more frequently / intensely, etc. 

You could do things in reverse. X happened, and although it was an extreme event, it is considered Y% less likely to occur in the current climate than the climate of 50 years ago.

I don't think it's that simple. First, a precise definition of ""extreme"" is not straight-forward, but the word is tossed around all the time. Your quote also mentions the number of disasters reported. Does higher reporting of disaster come from climate change, from population growth, better reporting systems or a little bit of everything? Even the IPCC report disagrees internally about the frequency trends of extreme events. 

Not to undermine my own point, we ought to try to use data, contextualize it and interpret it rather than relying on anecdotes, even though it is not straight-forward. Both sides of this way too polarized debate are too agenda driven in my estimation.

>Humans by default struggle to relate to numbers, it is only by personal anecdotes that we can get emotional connection and relate to how this is real and not some hypothetical.

Take your air pollution example.

When you don't have access to cheap energy like many developing countries do, they burn dung, wood and coal. The air quality is bad and premature death increases as a result.

I live on the ocean and have noticed no measurable sea level rise the last 50 years.

Of course, 1 mm of sea level rise is going to be hard to measure with a 3ft tidal range.

But by NOAA tide guages, the sea is rising a whopping 1mm per year.

According to satellites with an accuracy of measuring sea level from 100 miles in orbit that have ar best an accuracy of +-7.4 Centimeters, we are supposedly getting a statistical averaged sea level rise of 3mm per year.

Take whichever number you wish the sea isn't going to clear my seawall anytime in the next 1,000 years.

And by extension, the polar ice can not be melting at the rate claimed.

aaronturing,stisa79,"100% spot on.  Just to be clear but the arguments for global warming tend to hurt the argument. Way too many people who are against global warming use unscientific arguments or better put anecdotal evidence to explain why climate change is occurring.

The climate/weather interaction is complex and the best scientists state openly it is very hard to unpick the cause of specific weather events in relation to the issue being climate change.

Fires, floods, extinctions etc have been happening forever and not every negative weather even is due to climate change.

Let's demand better science and let's have less people stating stuff that is not scientific.

A good way to look at this is that if we don't have significant fires or floods does that mean climate change is not an issue.

Honest_Cynic,stisa79,"Better to discuss ""climate"" than ""weather events"".  Even among ""just climate"" much is not put into context.

Global warming sounds fearful, but is less fearful if much of the warming is at the Poles (other than melting glaciers raising sea level), or in Winter, or in warmer nights rather than hotter days.  Fearful warming reports tend to emphasize global-averaged air temperatures, but that is just the thin shell of atmosphere covering the planet, and subject to wide variations.

Some days in the last few years have had a global-averaged air temperature only 0.1 C above the historic baseline.  Most thermal mass is in the oceans, so ocean temperature is more representative, and should averaged over all depths.  That data has only become available since the early 2000's.  For a longer view, we must plot Sea Surface Temperature (SST), which is less representative of the planet's heat budget.  But, ocean temperatures have a long time lag in changing, so air and SST gives a better instantaneous picture, which can also be more alarming.",Can we please stop the anecdotal evidence?,"This is posted on both r/climatechange and r/climateskeptics, because I see it in abundance on both subs.

Ridiculous. Spending enormous sums changing everything about out our lives is implied to the extent of eating bugs, 15-minute cities, bikes & mass transit, intermittent renewables as Deutschland has discovered, EVs, poor charging infrastructure & no-drive zones that U.K. & DE are rebelling against that will destroy car jobs, more high-rises, less agriculture, rationed plane flights...

The ROI of CC ""solutions"" is extraordinary low. Suggest you read this, concentrating on the far lower death toll from climate since the 1920s despite 4x larger world population. Also note an expected world GDP increase by 2100 of 400+% with only mild degradation due to climate. That future certainly seems preferable to spending 10k euros per capita per year trying to make a small dent in world temperature when the EU only makes 7% of world CO2 & shrinking.

""All scientists say that civilization will not survive hothouse earth, especially with no time for ecosystems to adapt to fast change."" You then imply ""hothouse earth"" occurring within 100-200 years. 

First, I lived both in Germany & the Sinai/Arizona for 3 years each--you have no clue what temperatures humans can survive/thrive or how farmers can adapt, especially given more photosynthesis CO2 & resultant plants needing less water. There is this thing called genetic modification, too.

Second, recalling the technolgical advances of the past 50 years (vs. your 100-200 year doomsday) gotta express greater confidence in future engineering fixes rather than the judgment of CC scientists or Angela Merkel & company that shut down technologically advanced nuclear power. You know, the power source that has killed just 200 while successfully powering huge areas to include France? Compared your power bills to the U.S. anytime recently?

Nuclear is more green than geothermal in terms of emissions, Geothermal produces ~3x more CO2 than nuclear although both are ver low emission and geothermal is certainly very clean. 

Also nuclear waste is stored for hundreds of thousands of years, but that isn’t a bad thing. Its the only waste we don’t dump into the environment. And it sounds scary when people say it will remain radioactive for millions of years, which some isotopes will, but toxic waste remains toxic forever. The cites of coal plants will be polluted indefinitely. Mercury and heavy metals released from fossil fuels don’t decay, neither does the CO2. We have storage technology like [KBS-3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBS-3) to store nuclear waste nearly a kilometer deep in stable bedrock for hundreds of thousands of years when it reaches the radioactivity of naturally occurring ores.

It’s not a new idea at all, it has just had political opposition. In fact the US was supposed to build a deep geological repository back in the 80’s but it was delayed several decades and then canceled in the 2010’s for political reasons even though the site had proven to be safe/ideal and construction had begun.

There is only a specific subset of locations on earth viable for geothermal production on the scales we need. I support both. But I realize geo isn't going to solve the issue. Nuclear is the ONLY THING we have that can scale and is green.

Geo is green but can't scale like most of our green techs. Wind and solar are great but again. Can't scale and take huge swaths of land to satisfy. Nuclear is the only answer we have. It was the answer 50 years ago. But O&G are cheap and subsidized by many countries governments.

We are looking at our species next great energy leap. Nuclear is the next step. We can't put a geothermal plant on a space ship now can we. The energy density of nuclear is much more significant than I&g.

DirewaysParnuStCroix,Dylan0110,"By request. Quoted from Netweather discussion board...

"">*I recall some amount of shock that the 40°c mark was broken in this country during a La Niña year.*

Well, yes and no. 2022 was the final year of the 2020-22 triple Nina, and as previously mentioned, the summer of 1976 occurred in the final year of an exceptionally strong triple Nina (all three dips were to >-1.5 at their peaks, and I don't think a triple Nina of this amplitude has been repeated). The first half of 2022 was very dry (apart from February) as 76 was. The summer of 95 also occurred during a Nina. As I said, there is certainly a notable impact (I believe the NOAA even stated Nina was directly responsible for the five-wave jet stream pattern in 2022 and consequent severe heatwaves in Europe, but don't quote me on that one), but that impact isn't always clear. It can also sometimes be overwhelmed by other factors, like the +IOD in 2019/20 which is thought to be heavily correlated to the bulletproof PV that year.

However, the actual record breaking temperature is more of an oddball. Neither 76 or 95 broke the all-time record (95 didn't even record a top-10 hottest day), they were more slow burners. The big record breaks otherwise happen during El Nino (1990, 2003 & 2019). I have no idea if 1911 was a Nino year or not, but as it was somewhat similar to this year both in the States and Europe (not often both concurrently have a hot summer), I'd suggest there's a good chance it was. 1906, the year of the infamous 35.6C September record which this year's September heatwave was widely ticketed to finally beat, also fits the profile of a strong Nino.

**Now of course, the 2003 heatwave followed on from a moderate Nino which followed a triple Nina. We are now in a moderate (which will probably become strong) Nino and will be reaching peak temperature next year, and we just came out of a triple Nina. 2024 will be the closest oceanoatmospheric analogue to 2003 on paper since that year, except now we've had 21 more years of climate change and SSTs look to be higher than then, and Europe is also coming out of a string of bad summers, which it wasn't in 03. I would suggest that, at least on paper, the risk for exceptionally severe summer weather next year is very high**""","Scorching October puts 2023 on track to be hottest year in 125,000 years",,2023-11-09 14:52:50

Its unlikely they have 10% of the measurements required to make a decision and somehow it always comes out warmer by the tiniest margin. to get the very neat 0.2 Decade increase divides very nicely in to the time frame decided to work with and lines up very nicely with increasing CO2 that is allegedly going up still  even after America spent trillions trying to stop this and no one else bothered.
